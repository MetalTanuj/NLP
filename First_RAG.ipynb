It’s such a simple concept that my at the time nine-year-old picked up within seconds of me setting up his account. But it’s so much more than that.For me, it’s a way of life. It’s something I play with my hubby, son and friends. But it’s also my full-time job. Because of that I am definitely guilty of over-tinkering. It’s hard not to want to constantly make tweaks and changes. However, sometimes leaving it alone and not being tempted to over-tinker with your FPL team is the right thing to do – however hard that might be!The beginnings of a passionWhen I first started playing FPL it was something that I only thought about on a Friday night. I was teaching full-time and planning a wedding. On a Friday evening, I’d get home from school and before I logged off for the night I would set up my Fantasy team. This was in the days before I had a smartphone and mobile data was expensive! It meant that I didn’t always have team news or even the Fantasy website to hand. In those days Lee and I would sit in our living room and we would just chat about FPL and what we were doing with our teams. I was the epitome of a casual player.But when wedding planning was over I remember asking Lee if we could get a couple of kittens. His answer was absolutely not. But we struck a deal, if I beat him in FPL we could get them. He was confident that wouldn’t happen because for three seasons prior I hadn’t just lost to him but been completely destroyed. That season I bought myself my first FPL notebook, downloaded the app and logged in to FFScout (using Lee’s login, sorry ElFozzie!). To cut a very long story short I won and Harry and Archie joined our family.Now why am I telling you this? Back when I first started the game my time spent on my team was limited to maybe half-an-hour a week tops. Over the years that has grown. With that growth has got better mini-league finishes as well as hugely improved overall ranks. However, the amount of overthinking has increased too.OverthinkingLeaving aside my role as a content creator and as the Scout General Manager for a moment I think all Fantasy bosses have the potential to overthink decisions. The level of content that the Premier League alone puts out on the game has grown dramatically over the last few seasons. This means that even the most casual managers or those who are brand new to the game have access to so much knowledge about the best picks.A few seasons ago I started to streamline what I listened to and read. I did this to cancel out some of the noise. In the FPL community, you will always find someone who agrees with your view. You will also find multiple people who don’t. That knowledge is power, but it can also lead you to overthink and question your decisions. I do it all the time. Liam Delap (¬£5.6m) is a prime example of that. I spent hours looking at his stats and bigging him up on the Q&A, the Official FPL Pod, the Fantasy Show, Sky Sports News and FPL Family, only to not bring him in myself.There have been a couple of weeks this season where I have looked at my team and thought I could roll. But then for one reason or another I have made a transfer anyway. This week I am looking at my team and I like it.Of course, there are things that I think I could change – Valentin Barco (¬£4.0m), Dean Henderson (¬£4.5m) and Harry Winks (¬£4.5m) are at the top of that list. You can read more about those dilemmas here. The thing is that they are not issues that need solving this week. Barco and Winks can both be benched and Henderson might pick up some save points. However, it’s like trying to scratch an itch, especially where Henderson is concerned.Goalkeeper dilemmasI often describe goalkeeper transfers as unsexy. This has nothing to do with the players themselves, but everything to do with feeling like I want to make changes with huge potential upside that could be explosive. Goalkeepers have much lower ceilings than their outfield counterparts, simply because their route to points is smaller.This week I have looked at my 10 outfield players and thought, yes I am very happy to play you this week. That left me with the bench and goalkeeper. The likely right decision here is to hold the transfer to allow me to have two for Gameweek 9. In part this is because I could only afford a ¬£4.7m goalkeeper this week and I am not certain of a clean sheet for any of them priced under that mark. Therefore making a goalkeeper transfer this week could be risky. But because it, alongside Barco, is the weakest point in my team I feel the need to fix it. For 10 days since the Gameweek 7 deadline passed all I have thought about is a ‘keeper transfer.I have spent hours making goalkeeper comparisons and looking at their underlying numbers. In reality, I have massively overthought a decision that should be very simple. Hold Henderson and deal with him on my Wildcard. Or free up some money with two transfers next week and get a goalkeeper I want for the long term.Sometimes rolling those transfers is the right thing to do, even if you have itchy fingers and really want to make a transfer. Especially now that we can roll five.Fear of missing outThis is definitely the cause of my overthinking. I sit next to Lee every Sunday night recording FPL Family and hear about his Brennan Johnson (¬£6.6m) and Bryan Mbeumo (¬£7.5m) picks and I want them too. Then I record the pod with Juls and Kelly and the same happens again. Add that to listening to Az on the Q&A and it’s hard not to have the fear of missing out.In the early weeks of the season especially there is a temptation to jump from player to player. Worrying that the player you don’t have might outscore the one that you do can at times lead to overthought decisions.The FPL community is awash with expert articles and content all helping to make the right decision, but don’t be afraid to not have the player that everyone is talking about. I haven’t owned Mbeumo yet this season. I hide behind the sofa every time Brentford play and hope he doesn’t go too big. My only route to him in the last couple of weeks has been to sell Diogo Jota (¬£7.5m). I have resisted that transfer, even though it has been really difficult because it would have been for a -4. In the end, Jota has returned 16, whilst Mbeumo has 17 so there is only one point in it. That fear of missing out would have led to me being three points worse off had I made the transfer.Fear of missing out is real. But with the pricing the way it is this season that is going to be the case all year. It’s making for a really exciting season that we can’t own everyone we want and I am having to make peace with that.Avoid the overthinking trapLast season I had my worst finish in years. Don’t get me wrong it still wasn’t terrible but it’s not where I aim for. When I reflect on the 2023/24 campaign I know my biggest issue was overthinking. I had a horrible festive period last year which saw me return six red arrows on the bounce. After that everyone I care about beating was ahead of me.Every week I would produce content with some of the people I love most in the world and find the constant being behind really difficult. I felt myself shifting my approach to FPL. Taking gambles in the hope of clawing back some of the points I had lost. I overthought every decision. The sensible thing is to captain Erling Haaland (¬£15.4m), I went against it. Double up on the Arsenal defence? I stuck with one for way too long.This season I am trying to learn from that. I am making educated decisions with an attempt to strengthen my team for a period of time, rather than reacting. Patience is key, that’s how I have always played the game, so this season I am going back to that approach. This week I will have patience with Henderson. Yes he likely won’t keep a clean sheet, but if I hold this week then I can have a better pick next week by freeing up money from the second free transfer I will have banked.I was really excited when the PL introduced the rolling five transfers rule, now is the time to try and make some use of it.SIGN UP HERE FOR ALL THE TOOLS YOU NEED TO WIN AT FPL!Sam FPLFamily <p>Fantasy Football Scout's General Manager.

We're back.This is really shaping up to be a fun season. Sam is happy with her team and she has 6 different players to me. That's a huge amount and as a result the variance is gonna be pretty high.I see lots of different teams that I rate and find interesting and yet half the players are different to the ones I own.I'm also watching podcasts like Blackbox and FPL Wire and find myself disagreeing quite a lot on team structure, choices and what to prioritize. Pras for instance is booking in an Ederson > Raya transfer in GW12 which doesn't make much sense to me, and Lateriser is going to sell Trent to fund Foden. Both moves which I really don't agree with and yet I can understand their reasoning.Meanwhile I think Havertz is a season keeper at that price through the tough fixtures and people are looking to sell him this week or next week for Solanke. Interesting times ahead. Open Controls PermalinkLogin To Reply   Tonyawesome69 2 hours, 56 mins agoI think the Ederson to Raya luxury GK move depends on how set the rest of the team is and number of FTs available. Doubt he would make the move when GW12 comes round and has fires to put out.Agreed on the TAA downgrade to afford Foden, doesn't feel great at the moment with how Foden's seasons going so far.Difficult to pick 3 from Raya/Gabriel/Saka/Havertz - all are good picks. Open Controls PermalinkLogin To Reply   Camzy 2 hours, 33 mins agoThe reason I think it's crazy is that he has to make 2 moves. Sell Havertz to free the 3rd Arsenal slot and then use a transfer to change Ederson > Raya. And yet he seems so set on it. Raya has scored 3 points in the last 2 weeks. He scored well at the start of the season because he made an unusually high number of saves. Arsenal's xGC is actually mid-table so far and he's exceeded his xGP. I think it's likely the regression will be back towards getting 6s and 2s. This is not a position worth a transfer this season especially since Ederson is more than fine and there are some cheaper keepers like Pickford, Sels, Sanchez even Hermansen that look like they can compete for less. Open Controls PermalinkLogin To Reply   Ausman 2 hours, 31 mins agoGreat post Camzy!Agree with most of what you say, Havertz & TAA are both nailed for the season in my team. Also agree with Tony that come GW12, Pras may well have a change of mind.I have Raul in my team and think he is being overlooked considering his price and the returns he is getting. He's a gem and the money saved means better players elsewhere in my team.When you look at the top teams after each GW, there is a variety of ways to structure a team this season.

Once aboard, youâ€™ve locked in the price of your Premium Membership for good, so long as you donâ€™t cancel!This season’s FPL seems much more fun than it has been for the last few years. This has nothing to do with the outcomes but more about the number of decisions we’ve had to make and the optionality in picks. There seems to be no clear â€˜templateâ€™ and long may that continue.There are many ways to skin a draft and none are objectively right or wrong, with the tough pricing meaning it’ll be difficult to own more than three or four premiums at once.Keeping that in mind, I thought it might be worth paying close attention to these big hitters and premiums to assess their performances versus different kinds of opposition, what upcoming fixtures they have and try to decipher if there are any trends we can spot with them.For example, is Bukayo Saka (Â£10.1m) fixture-proof? How much of a flat-track bully is he compared to Cole Palmer (Â£10.8m)? Diving deeper into this will hopefully pay rewards and it’s just generally fun data to look at.THE KOLAROV, LESCOTT + BRAMBLE TABLEI did the ‘Kolarov, Lescott and Brambleâ€™ table last year, looking at performance data against good, average and poor defences. Letâ€™s check it out.To categorise opponents, I base it on expected goals conceded (xGC). The top six are Kolarov, the middle six are Lescott and the bottom eight are Bramble.What this table shows us is the points per start against all three categories, plus a home-away breakdown.This time, I went a little deeper into the data, adding some underlying numbers to it. Which is why I’ve also created the table below.

I hope this table helps you with your decision-making and, again, if you spot anything interesting, tell me on X.

The Egyptian’s score of 303 FPL points remains the highest in a single season. Salah can, of course, point out that his triple century came from just 34 starts and two substitute appearances.Of the teams he’s faced since his full debut, there are only two he’s yet to return against: Aston Villa and Liverpool. Palmer actually encountered the Villans on four occasions last season, twice in the FA Cup and once as a substitute in Gameweek 6; they stopped him from scoring each time.He can complete the set in the next six Gameweeks, with the Reds up this Sunday and Villa to follow in Gameweek 13.The trio of newly promoted clubs, Leicester City, Southampton and Ipswich Town, are all to come after the November international break.Manchester United are a favourite opponent: he has already stuck four goals past the Red Devils. Palmer notched a treble at Stamford Bridge, racking up nine shots – a tally he’s not beaten since – in the process.PALMER V OTHERS SINCE HIS FULL CHELSEA DEBUT \\xa0The rest of this article below is completely free to read but requires a Fantasy Football Scout user account for access – you can get yours at no cost hereSIGN UP HERE FOR ALL THE TOOLS YOU NEED TO WIN AT FPL!Skonto Rigga Neale is the Editor of Fantasy Football Scout.

Mohamed Salah (£12.7m) wasn’t far behind on 165’.The Reds dropped points for the first time in 2024/25, however, slumping to a 1-0 defeat in uninspiring fashion.Luis Diaz (£8.0m), Alexis Mac Allister (£6.3m) and Diogo Jota (£7.4m) all started but were hooked on the hour.International exertions were perhaps a factor, especially in Diaz’s case, having started and finished the World Cup qualifier against Argentina on the Tuesday before. The match kicked off at 9.30pm BST.Slot later intriguingly said that Cody Gakpo (£7.1m) was under consideration to start over Diaz in Gameweek 4.“I would have planned to play Cody on Saturday but Cody, for the first time [this season], played two games with the Dutch national team and Lucho [Diaz] was more fit than Cody on Saturday, so that’s why Lucho played.” – Arne SlotThis time Liverpool have the advantage of playing on Sunday in Gameweek 8, allowing for an extra day of rest.“The difference between this international break and the last one is this time we play a late kick-off [on] Sunday and last time we played on Saturday. So, it gives us one extra day of rest, which is always helpful, especially for the ones that come back with jet lag from South America.” – Arne Slot’s thoughts about Gameweek 8, speaking on October 4MANCHESTER CITYGameweek 4 fixture: v Brentford (h), Sat 3pmGameweek 4 line-up: Ederson; Walker, Stones (Dias 83), Akanji, Lewis (Gvardiol 46); Kovacic (Rodri 46), Gundogan; Savinho (Nunes 90+1), De Bruyne, Grealish (Bernardo 83); HaalandHaving made only one, enforced, change in Gameweeks 1-3, Pep Guardiola made four alterations to his line-up against Brentford.John Stones (£5.3m), Kyle Walker (£5.3m) and Ilkay Gundogan (£6.5m) made their first starts of the season. Savinho (£6.5m) returned on the wing.They replaced Ruben Dias (£5.5m), Josko Gvardiol (£5.9m), Bernardo Silva (£6.5m) and Jeremy Doku (£6.3m).The two defenders had played the maximum 180 minutes during the international break, while Bernardo and Doku lasted 158/157’ respectively.Gvardiol was introduced at half-time, replacing Rico Lewis (£4.7m). Pep Guardiola failed to explain why in his post-match press conferences and interviews.As for Erling Haaland (£15.4m), he started and finished the match, despite playing 180 minutes for Norway. His mental state was assessed leading up to the clash after the sad passing of close friend Ivar Eggja.Like Liverpool, City also play on Sunday in Gameweek 8, allowing for additional rest time.ARSENALGameweek 4 fixture: v Tottenham Hotspur (a), Sun 2pmGameweek 4 line-up: Raya; White, Saliba, Gabriel, Timber; Saka (Nwaneri 84), Partey, Jorginho, Martinelli (Sterling 80); Havertz, Trossard (Jesus 80)Mikel Arteta made two enforced changes to his starting XI for last month’s north London derby.With Declan Rice (£6.3m) suspended and Martin Odegaard (£8.2m) injured, Jorginho (£4.8m) and Gabriel Martinelli (£7.0m) came in.Arsenal had the advantage of playing on Sunday in Gameweek 4, however. This allowed for an extra day of rest for Gabriel Magalhaes (£6.2m) and co.Gabriel, David Raya (£5.6m), William Saliba (£6.0m) and Kai Havertz (£8.3m) all played the maximum 180 minutes for their respective countries during the international break.Saka featured for 156’ minutes, meanwhile.The 34.8%-owned midfielder limped off during England’s 2-1 loss to Greece on Thursday night, but interim boss Lee Carsley suggested that it isn’t serious and there is optimism that Saka will be fit for Gameweek 8.READ MORE: Saka injury latest + Johnson’s “precautionary” subBRIGHTON AND HOVE ALBIONGameweek 4 fixture: v Ipswich Town (h), Sat 3pmGameweek 4 line-up: Verbruggen; Veltman, van Hecke, Dunk, Hinshelwood (Kadioglu 66); Minteh (Adingra 67), Baleba, Ayari, Mitoma; Rutter (Enciso 66), Welbeck (Ferguson 84)At Brighton, Fabian Hurzeler had to make two changes as Joao Pedro (£5.5m) and James Milner (£5.0m) both missed out through injury.In their absence, Georginio Rutter (£5.5m) made his first start for the club, while Yasin Ayari (£5.0m) came into midfield.There was plenty of pre-match talk about whether post-international fatigue would curtail Joao Pedro’s minutes in Gameweek 4.In the end, a “small issue” put paid to his involvement.Elsewhere, Yankuba Minteh (£5.4m) started but was poor and hooked on 67 minutes, having played twice for Gambia during the international break.OTHERSChris Wood (£6.2m) had a late return from international duty in America last month, having played in the early hours of Wednesday morning. He started and lasted 79 minutes at Anfield, however.Bruno Fernandes (£8.2m) played 180 minutes for Portugal in September and was sighted hobbling in the closing stages of the win over Scotland. He went on to play the entirety of the Saturday early kick-off at Southampton.The likes of Cristian Romero (£5.1m), Son Heung-min (£9.9m), Bryan Mbeumo (£7.5m), Antoine Semenyo (£5.7m) and Nicolas Jackson (£7.9m) all racked up 135+ minutes on international duty but also started in Gameweek 4.Ezri Konsa (£4.5m), Ollie Watkins (9.1m) and Cole Palmer (£10.8m) were all fit to start following minor injury scares over the September international break, completing 90, 82 and 90 minutes respectively.However, Yves Bissouma (£4.9m) missed out after returning from international duty with a minor injury, Enzo Fernandez (£4.9m) was ill, while Alejandro Garnacho (£6.3m) – late back from South America – was benched.Meanwhile, Michail Antonio (£5.4m) was subbed off at half-time in Gameweek 4 after not registering a single shot at Fulham. He played 174 minutes for Jamaica leading up to the clash, with the final match kicking off at 3am BST the Wednesday before.Team-mate Lucas Paqueta (£5.9m) dropped to the bench, although there have been suggestions he was under the weather rather than fatigued from his international excursions with Brazil.THE GAMEWEEK 4 LATE RETURNEES: MINUTES PLAYED IN THE SUBSEQUENT PREMIER LEAGUE MATCHCountryFinal international match played in… (date/kick-off time in BST)Players (mins in final international match)Players (mins in GW4, start in bold)ArgentinaColombia (10 Sep, 9.30pm)E.

Dakers 132 CommentsShareA clean sheet and two bonus points in last Saturday’s narrow win at Crystal Palace took Trent Alexander-Arnold (£7.1m) top of the FPL defenders points table after the opening seven Gameweeks of the season.That’s far from unfamiliar ground for the Liverpool right-back, and is perhaps expected by the roughly 31% of managers who own him, given he’s the most expensive defensive asset in the game by nearly £1.0m.But how do Alexander-Arnold’s stats compare to last season, and to the dizzying 200-plus point heights of 2019/20 and 2021/22?As we contemplate what to do with him from Gameweek 8 onwards, let’s take a look.The basicsThis seasonHeading into this October international break, Liverpool have by far the Premier League’s best defensive record, with five clean sheets and just two goals conceded (GC) in seven games.A mainstay in the Reds’ backline when fit, Alexander-Arnold has started all seven of those fixtures, with the shut-outs and six total bonus points (joint-top for defensive options in FPL alongside Diogo Dalot and David Raya) helping him rake in 41 points so far at an average of 5.9 per appearance.Not for a lack of trying, Alexander-Arnold’s only attacking return so far has been an assist against Bournemouth in Gameweek 5.\\xa0Last seasonOverall, it has been a much better start than Alexander-Arnold managed in the same period during an injury-hit 2023/24 campaign, which saw him make five appearances (four starts) and earn 17 total FPL points, at a per appearance average of 3.4.Over those opening seven games last autumn, which Alexander-Arnold missed two of through injury, Liverpool were admittedly a poorer defensive unit, keeping just one clean sheet and conceding seven times.All in all, injuries limited him to 25 league starts in his last season under Jurgen Klopp.With only three additional substitute appearances, that restricted gametime brought just five assists – his lowest tally since 2017/18 – and three goals, with eight clean sheets and 19 total bonus points averaging him out to 4.4 FPL points per appearance.\\xa0If he can stay fit, those are numbers we’d expect Alexander-Arnold to pass quite easily this year, at least based on the first seven weeks of evidence.2021/22As Liverpool ran Manchester CIty down to the wire in that season’s title race, Alexander-Arnold bagged two goals, 12 assists and a whopping 18 clean sheets in 2021/22, adding 32 bonus points for an FPL total of 208 points.He averaged 6.5 points per appearance, with a goal involvement roughly every 180 minutes.2019/20Back in the Reds’ title-winning season, meanwhile, Alexander-Arnold secured his best total FPL tally to date, with 210 points (5.5 per appearance).Though his clean sheet (14) and bonus point (24) stats were lower than 2021/22, that all-time mark was achieved by Liverpool’s home-grown full-back appearing in all 38 matches, scoring four goals and notching 15 total assists.Now we’ll check out some of the key underlying metrics from the opening seven weeks of this season to see how Alexander-Arnold’s stats stack up against his old self in years past.Chance creationHe’s proven to have some brilliant goals in his locker, but assists have long been Alexander-Arnold’s bread and butter – and the main reason for his status as an FPL all-time great.2024/25: 7 matches, 1 assist2023/24: 28 matches, 5 assists2021/22: 32 matches, 12 assists2019/20: 38 matches, 15 assistsAs well as those tallies above, Alexander-Arnold managed 11 assists the season before last, and 13 assists in 2018/19 – meaning he has only failed to rack up double-digits in the assist stat column twice since his breakout season).This season so far, a look at the xA stats show he’s perhaps unlucky to have just one assist to show for his efforts.2024/252023/242021/222019/20Chances created per app2.32.32.82.3Big chances created per app0.70.60.60.5Expected assists (xA) per app0.40.20.40.3Crosses per app4.96.08.510.1Alexander-Arnold is averaging 0.4 xA per appearance over these first seven matches, which matches his performance in that metric over the course of 2021/22 as well as bettering last season (0.2) and even his 15-assist campaign in 2019/20 (0.3).In terms of chances created per appearance, his current average of 2.3 so far in 2024/25 trails his season-long rate of 2.8 per appearance in 2021/22 and equals both last season and 2019/20. Alexander-Arnold’s current rate of 0.7 big chances created per match, however, is his best-ever.Alexander-Arnold’s number of crosses per appearance (4.9) over these first seven Gameweeks is the lowest of the four seasons we’ve looked at – and trails his averages of 8.5 and 10.1 in 2021/22 and 2019/20, respectively, by some ways.\\xa0But, his cross completion rate (32.4%) is around the same as last year and trumps both of his top-scoring FPL seasons – quality over quantity?Though his number of corners taken per appearance has dropped from a peak of 4.3 in 2019/20 to around 2.5 both last year and so far in this campaign, the number of those deliveries which have been successful (around one per match) has stayed roughly the same.\\xa0That also means no defender has more successful corners this season than Alexander-Arnold’s six (from 18 attempts), although Leif Davis (£4.5m) and Andy Robertson (£6.0m) have attempted more corner kicks, with 27 (five successful) and 24 (six successful), respectively.Shots This content is restricted to Premium Members.\\nClick here to register and get access to Opta stats, the Rate My Team tool, Points Projections, 150+ Premium Member articles, exclusive videos, a customisable Season Ticker, the FFS Transfer Planner... and more!SIGN UP HERE FOR ALL THE TOOLS YOU NEED TO WIN AT FPL!Dakers <p>London-based freelance journalist, frequently with The i (inews.co.uk), Fantasy Football Scout, and BBC Sport.</p><p>Bylines including RadioTimes, Cayman Compass, NBC, The Stanford Daily.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Got a story?

The latter played three Everton attackers in their 0-0, whereas Tom F swooped in to benefit from Jordan Pickford‘s clean sheet and penalty save.MATCHDAY 8At the time of writing, three managers have adjusted their roster in preparation for the next round of games. But there’s still over a week to go.In addition to bringing in Nikola Milenkovic for Marcos Senesi, Tom J sold the injured Joao Pedro for West Ham United’s Michail Antonio. This allowed the Brazilian forward to be collected by Neale for later usage, in exchange for Omari Hutchinson.Marc was another to invest in Nottingham Forest’s defence: Murillo comes in for Emerson.“Another week of being absolutely robbed by Spurs players. Last time out, I was mugged by a van der Ven and Johnson combo from Sam, plus Fernandes getting harshly sent off. This time, Ed took a well deserved lead via Gakpo and Jota but I was clawing it back and just needed a Porro to keep a clean sheet against Brighton. “Suffice to say, they ‘Spursed it up’ and the Fielding Foxes experienced another narrow defeat. Mind you, I’ll have to take some of the rap for resting Pereira. I need a week to lick wounds, let the lads recover and maybe make a roster change before going head-to-head with Neale and team Skonto Rigga. Come on you Foxes!” – Chris James, manager of Fielding FoxesLooking at Matchday 8’s fixtures, what stands out is that eight of the 10 have the same record of two wins and two losses. The only two who don’t – Scott and Tom J – are about to face off.New to the Scout team, Scott picked up his first defeat last time and is hoping to bounce back versus bottom-of-the-table Tom.JOIN OUR SCOUT PICK’EM LEAGUEAlongside the Sleeper Fantasy FC draft, there’s Pick’em – a Premier League prediction league – and you can join the Scout one for free by clicking here.In Pick’em, all you do is predict wins and draws for the upcoming matches, earning a point for every correct guess.Not only is there a football shirt of choice to win each month but the overall season-long winner gets Â£7,500 worth of prizes!SIGN UP HERE FOR ALL THE TOOLS YOU NEED TO WIN AT FPL!FPLMarc Newcastle fan that spends far too much time thinking about FPL. 40 Comments Post a Comment  By: DateRatingSticky       Amartey Partey 2 days, 6 hours agoI’m seriously thinking of transferring in Grealish for a few games.

The club was already in serious debt. The future of the club looked in major doubt, until the club captain was able to find 4 local business men who invested £2,000 in the club. The main investor John Davies became the new club president and made a few changes - their colours went from green/gold to red/white and the name was changed to Manchester United Football Club!Over the next century, the club grew to world class standard accumulating trophies in all fronts both at home and in Europe.

Once aboard, youâ€™ve locked in the price of your Premium Membership for good, so long as you donâ€™t cancel!With it being the international break and the usual Q&A to follow next week, I thought I would use this article to pen my thoughts on the questions Iâ€™m asking myself for the upcoming schedule.Is it time to hop off Trent Alexander-Arnold?As the above image from the Season Ticker shows, Liverpool had the most favourable schedule in the league over the first seven Gameweeks. The only â€˜difficultâ€™ fixture was the away trip to Manchester United – and we all know how that turned out.Â\\xa0Arne Slot’s side have kept five clean sheets in seven games and conceded only two goals. If we were to extrapolate that to the entire season, it would break all sorts of records.Â\\xa0But you donâ€™t need to be a rocket scientist to conclude thatâ€™s not going to happen, especially when you look at the schedule for the Reds on the other side of the second international break:Liverpool play Chelsea, Arsenal, Villa and Manchester City in four of the next six matches. The other games are Brighton and Southampton. Thereâ€™s also the European and domestic schedule to consider; they do not have a free midweek anytime soon:They travel to Leipzig between Chelsea and Arsenal, host Leverkusen prior to Villa, and entertain Real Madrid before Manchester City. Games we consider prime for Fantasy investment, such as the Southampton match, could see rotation or early substitutions.Â\\xa0Is now the time to hop off Trent Alexander-Arnold (Â£7.1m) and spread that money elsewhere, perhaps going for two premiums in midfield such as Bukayo Saka (Â£10.1m)/Phil Foden (Â£9.2m) and Cole Palmer (Â£10.8m)?Â\\xa0With the massive hauls coming from the premium midfielders recently, Iâ€™m wary of building a narrative in order to bring myself to sell Alexander-Arnold. As the numbers below show, he is in a league of his own in terms of attacking numbers: his 2.88 non-penalty expected goal involvements (NPxGI) are well clear of second-placed Leif Davis (Â£4.5m, 1.68):Do we pick and stick with the premium midfielders or hop on/off with fixtures?Right when the prices were released, it was clear that this season was going to be different from last. There was no way you could own Erling Haaland (Â£15.4m), Saka, Palmer, Foden and Mohamed Salah (Â£12.7m) like last season. Every week, there are going to be 2-3 premium, quality assets you donâ€™t own who are capable of a haul.The initial thinking was to look for the best schedules and jump on/off the premium assets depending on fixture difficulty. However, I think with the data we have, and although it is limited and skewed by fixture difficulty/freak occurrences like that Brighton and Hove Albion game, we can potentially look to rank them.Haaland is not included in this for now, although he is of course expendable as many of the no-Haaland teams in the upper-rank echelons have shown.However, someone like Palmer we need to think about. Chelseaâ€™s next four games are against Liverpool, Newcastle United, Arsenal and Manchester United. Do we invest in Palmer for that run or do we keep faith in someone like Saka?Fixtures do matter. Sakaâ€™s numbers for the last two home matches were absurd both in terms of shots and chance creation. He simply did not have the same numbers away to Tottenham Hotspur etc.But despite his high shot volume, his xG per shot remains low. I think he is more of a ‘trickler’ than someone like Palmer, who is capable of a 20-point haul – as he has shown us twice already. The win over Southampton was only the second time in his career that Saka has had three attacking involvements in a game.Then thereâ€™s someone like Foden, who has the most potential for rank gains given his low ownership and the best fixture schedule over the upcoming four weeks. However, he is clearly not fully up to speed yet and with Kevin De Bruyne (Â£9.4m) potentially back after the international break, could we see rotation for Foden? Itâ€™s possible and his minutes are nowhere near as secure as those of Palmer or Saka.Now, a lot of this could be rendered pointless if Saka is ruled out for an extended period with the injury he suffered while playing for England. But itâ€™s a larger question, especially now that Son Heung-min (Â£9.9m) is nearing a return to fitness for Spursâ€™ excellent run.Teams like Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool etc will continue to score goals irrespective of fixtures and these talismanic midfielders will continue to be involved. So this is something worth thinking about over the break.The mid-priced forwards offer so much more than the budget onesIgnoring Haaland in the above image, it is clear that the other top four forwards for NPxGI are all priced at Â£7.5m or over. The numbers they are posting are significant and not too far behind Haaland for significantly cheaper – in Dominic Solankeâ€™s (Â£7.6m) case it is less than half Haalandâ€™s price. And Solanke has missed two games!When you compare that to some of the other popular budget forwards, such as Dominic Calvert-Lewin (Â£6.0m), who has less than half (2.49) the NPxGI as Nicolas Jackson (Â£7.9m, 5.40), I am asking myself: why not spend the extra Â£1.5m-Â£2m? You are getting entry into teams with much better attacking potential. Granted, Jackson has his own issues of xMins but players like Solanke and Kai Havertz (Â£8.3m) are nailed for 90 minutes and posting great numbers.I think spending extra on that position gives you a bigger upgrade than say a Dwight McNeil (Â£5.7m) to a Jarrod Bowen (Â£7.4m) in midfield.Â\\xa0We discuss some of these thoughts and more on this weekâ€™s episode of the FPL Wire, where we take stock of the seven Gameweeks so far.

Reports suggest Alisson Becker (Â£5.5m) could be out until the November international break with the injury he sustained in Gameweek 7, with the Republic of Ireland international set to deputise. Kelleher played in 10 of Liverpoolâ€™s 38 Premier League games last season, and unlike Alisson, had a positive xGP.+3.3 xGP by Andre Onana (Â£5.0m) this season, which no other Fantasy Premier League (FPL) goalkeeper except Mads Hermansen (Â£4.5m) can better. The Manchester United shot-stopper has arguably been the clubâ€™s standout player in 2024/25, with four clean sheets in seven Premier League appearances. Erik ten Hagâ€™s side sit top of our Season Ticker in the next half-dozen Gameweeks.DEFENDERS17 chances created by Ipswich Townâ€™s Leif Davis (Â£4.5m) this season â€“ no FPL defender has registered more. Set pieces are a big part of his appeal, as 46.7% of the Tractor Boys goal attempts in 2024/25 have come from dead-ball situations â€“ no other Premier League club has a higher ratio.9 shots, 16 penalty box touches, nine key passes and one big chance created by Rayan Ait-Nouri (Â£4.4m) this season. The Algerian international is the top FPL defender for StatsBomb expected goals (xG) in 2024/25.

The Mauritanian team plays hard and with violent interventions, and their field is not the best. If Salah specifically asks me to do so, I will agree.“I was very worried about the Mauritania match, and the pitch there is very difficult. Even if I don’t win there, it doesn’t matter. What matters to me is that I don’t lose.” – Egypt manager Hossam HassanAnd that request duly came, with Liverpool confirming his early return on Saturday.“The pair will now take no further part in either international camp this month after the decision was made to relieve them early from their respective commitments.” – Liverpool club statement on Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed SalahThat’s a welcome boost for Salah (and van Dijk) owners ahead of Gameweek 8, giving the Egyptian a decent nine-day breather before next Sunday’s clash with Chelsea.SIGN UP HERE FOR ALL THE TOOLS YOU NEED TO WIN AT FPL!Skonto Rigga Neale is the Editor of Fantasy Football Scout.

I\\'m a viewer of the show and that\\'s pure nonsense.Mark, the creator of the site you are posting on, is one of the most insightful, knowledgeable, unassuming creators in this space.I think your post is tediously yawnful tbh based on nothing really but a personal attack.I am always open to the peeps out there that are looking for angles to beat the template and the bleedin\\' obvious so what\\'s the problem? Open Controls PermalinkLogin To Reply   _Freddo 3 days, 3 hours agoNo, they don’t, I stopped listening when they showed the defensive table and kept pointing out how Arsenal were way down where they should be completely ignoring that they had 3 or the hardest aways in 5 (Villa, City & Spurs) had 10 men for 2 of the games & still managed to keep CS in 2 of those games.That’s when the penny dropped, it’s worthless listening to data driven pods with little or no context.Yes, I know who Mark is, if you look next to my name you’ll see a 15 (where your 1 is) & I also follow his ‘career’ so my point stands, when you ‘look for big differentials’ to beat the game & high owned premiums in GW1, you know something has been lost in your style of play or you’re trying too hard.

Open Controls PermalinkLogin To Reply   _Freddo 3 days, 3 hours agoNo, I disagree, a defence will clearly be down on past years performance/perception when they’ve had hard fixs, to ignore that and point to data instead of context means it’s a waste of time persisting with it, the fact that Arsenal went away to City, Villa & Spurs in this period & kept 2 CS while having 10 men for over a half in the other shows that the defensive organisation & shape outweighs any data, you can watch football with your eyes rather than being led by numbers sometimes, it is allowed.Feel free to listen to it, I’m just not interested anymore in data driven pods like that unless there’s an element of context to support it, as a customer (by way of giving them my ears) it is my right to judge/be judgemental. Back to how he plays, he’s my favourite player of all time so I’m fully aware of his style but I’ve noticed a change in the last couple of years where’s he’s trying to be too clever to perform to his pod, he’s become obsessed with what the others are doing which is leading him down a path when making his decisions, good luck to him, just pointing out my observations. Open Controls PermalinkLogin To Reply   _Freddo 3 days, 3 hours agoFWIW, the second half display at City outweighs any data from that half to determine if a defence is good or not.Context matters, pods are straying too far down the number side & further away from the context.

He had picked up a leg injury in Thursday’s loss to Greece.An England statement said:“Saka has returned to Arsenal for further assessment having been substituted during the second-half of\\xa0Thursday night‚Äôs match against Greece.”In his pre-match presser ahead of the Finland game, interim England boss Lee Carsley gave a more positive update.‚ÄúBukayo would have been close but it would have been unfair to take a risk with him. He‚Äôs a positive person and I expect him to be fine.‚Äù – Lee Carsley on Bukayo SakaThat comment from Carsley is a bit of a boost, as there’s little chance of getting a clear-cut update from Mikel Arteta in his pre-match presser this Friday.Ange Postecoglou is someone who is usually a bit more forthcoming with team news.He might be able to shed more insight on Brennan Johnson (¬£6.6m). The in-form winger was substituted at half-time of Wales’ draw with Iceland on Friday as a “precaution”.“It was a precaution. He took a kick. He did feel something from impact so we’ll get him checked out.” – Craig Bellamy on Brennan Johnson, via the BBCJohnson will miss Monday’s clash with Montenegro through suspension anyway.Above: Saka and Johnson trail only Bryan Mbeumo (¬£7.5m) for Gameweek 8 transfers inSIGN UP HERE FOR ALL THE TOOLS YOU NEED TO WIN AT FPL!Skonto Rigga Neale is the Editor of Fantasy Football Scout.

Once aboard, youâ€™ve locked in the price of your Premium Membership for good, so long as you donâ€™t cancel!Humans, and FPL managers, are wired to prioritise immediate rewards over future ones. This is a background mental process that behavioural scientists call â€˜temporal hyperbolic discountingâ€™ or â€˜present biasâ€™. Present bias is considered to be a cognitive bias because, rationally speaking, future rewards should be viewed the same as immediate rewards of the same value. Future rewards of greater value should definitely be preferred to immediate rewards of a lesser value. Yet very often we donâ€™t follow this line of thinking, in life or our FPL decision-making.From the perspective of behavioural science, â€˜present biasâ€™ is irrational, yet it arguably brings both pros and cons. Whether this tendency may help or hinder our decision-making in FPL will be the focus of this weekâ€™s article.Night GuyIn his stand-up routine â€˜Night Guyâ€™, comedian Jerry Seinfeld explains that he never gets enough sleep because, at night, heâ€™s â€˜night guyâ€™, and night guy wants to stay up late. Not getting enough sleep and having to go to work is “morning guyâ€™s problem”.Despite only being 34 seconds long, this routine perfectly sums up the problems that present bias can cause. We make decisions in the short term that our future selves might not thank us for.In FPL, we often find ourselves over-investing in short-term opportunities at the expense of longer-term opportunities of potentially greater value. One way this manifests itself is in how we look at fixtures and our tendency to be overly influenced by the immediate one or two matches in a fixture run.\\xa0This bias can work in either direction. For example, we might bring a player in because they have one really good fixture, even if their following fixtures appear less inviting. Alternatively, we might ignore a player who has one tough fixture followed by a run of good ones. This is particularly the case when weâ€™re selecting our squads in pre-season or when weâ€™re using our Wildcards.Equally, when it comes to using transfers, weâ€™re aware that we can usually have a more positive effect on our teams when we use multiple transfers together rather than just one at a time. Yet when given the opportunity to bank a transfer, we often opt to use it instead, even if this means making a lower-impact change than we might have been able to make if weâ€™d waited.As with many things in life, patience is a virtue when it comes to FPL. Yet, our preference for short-term gains often leaves us sacrificing an opportunity for bigger gains in the long term.The Pros of Temporal DiscountingAs is often the case when it comes to discussing cognitive biases, there is a counter-perspective by which it is argued that these biases exist for a reason. Rather than fight against them, we should lean into the ways in which they might benefit us.When it comes to present bias, this perspective can be neatly summed up by the common phrase â€˜a bird in the hand is worth two in the bushâ€™. The long-term rewards might be greater, but how much can we rely on them still being there when the time comes? If there is significant doubt here, we might be better off trying to bank the, albeit smaller, short-term opportunity.There is a lot of sense to this perspective because, even though we usually try and plan for a stretch of Gameweeks, we all know that even a single Gameweek can be a long time in FPL. Players go in and out of form. They get injured, rested or dropped. They change position. Their FPL price changes… and so on. Football and FPL are so dynamic that any attempt at rigid, long-term planning often becomes an exercise in futility.We could argue that the same is true of using transfers. The longer-term opportunity that comes from banking them might be greater, but it may also be less certain than the short-term opportunity. Points are points at the end of the day and, when we get a chance to score some, can we afford to let that chance pass us by?The long and the short of itSo, which perspective is correct? Should we commit to long-term planning and the potential for greater rewards? Or should we take the short-term opportunities as they present themselves, even if the rewards are likely to be smaller?Youâ€™ve probably already guessed that both perspectives can be correct and which one it is depends on the particular context. The key is to acknowledge and actively question our bias for the short term so that we can properly judge the size of the relative opportunities on the table, and the risks associated with each. Once weâ€™ve done this, we can make a rational decision on whether to try and grasp the immediate opportunity in front of us or sacrifice it in favour of a bigger one down the line.Take, for example, those who Triple Captained Manchester Cityâ€™s Erling Haaland (Â£15.4m) for his 17-point haul against Ipswich Town in Gameweek 2. Itâ€™s very possible these managers were subconsciously influenced by their biased preference for immediate gains over potentially greater future ones, but this doesnâ€™t mean that their decisions were wrong or without logic. Haaland had, on paper, one of the best fixtures heâ€™ll have all season. While time will tell whether playing it then maximised the value of the Triple Captain chip or not, nobody could argue, even if it had failed, that there wasnâ€™t logic to the decision.Â\\xa0The important thing, when thinking about present bias, is to remember that it is there, working in the background. Therefore, it is to our benefit, when making an FPL decision that favours short-term interests, to sense-check whether this decision comes from a sober and rational assessment of the opportunity, or from our deep-rooted impulse to pursue immediate rewards. If it is the latter, maybe itâ€™s worth considering the move further.More broadly, it may also help to remind ourselves that the payoff for certain moves cannot always be properly measured by the results of a single Gameweek. We typically plan for multiple Gameweeks so it makes sense to measure success over an extended period too. By taking a longer view of success, we become less influenced by the immediate term and our decision-making may become clearer and less biased as a result.SIGN UP HERE FOR ALL THE TOOLS YOU NEED TO WIN AT FPL!Posted by simonm 120 Comments Post a Comment  By: DateRatingSticky       The Knights Template 4 days, 6 hours agoHello Simon March!

These have ranged from unlimited budgets to double points for certain players.Most recently, we have witnessed themed series. In Gameweeks 5-7, for instance, the focus was on players from the Americas, Africa and Asia-Pacific respectively.WHAT ARE THE UPCOMING FANTASY CHALLENGES?In Gameweeks 8-11, the challenges are as follows:Gameweek 8 – Ball Winners: Interceptions and tackles are worth 1 point, recoveries are worth 1 pointGameweek 9 – Playmakers: Key passes and crosses worth 2 pointsGameweek 10 – Foul Play: Fouls won are worth 2 points, fouls conceded are worth -1 pointGameweek 11 – Accuracy: Shots on target are worth 3 pointsWHY IS THIS SIGNIFICANT TO FPL?Bespoke scoring is nothing new to Fantasy Challenge.However, this Gameweek 8-11 series is entitled ‘Test Lab’.The accompanying blurb is even more intriguing:“Shape the future of Fantasy Premier League by joining in on our experiments. This series we are running four tests that focus on earning points through different players and playstyles. What new FPL assets become must-haves?”It may be, then, that the games-makers are trying to gauge user reaction to a more wide-ranging scoring system before potentially implementing it in FPL for 2025/26.Bonuses for ball recoveries, shots on target, key passes and/or tackles are already used in games such as UCL Fantasy and Fantasy EFL.FPL may be belatedly joining the party.WHICH PLAYERS WOULD BENEFIT FROM THE NEW BONUS POINTS?If you’re taking part in the next four Gameweeks of Fantasy Challenge, or are curious to know who would benefit from the new bonus points, here are the leading players for each metric (click each image to expand) via the official site:RECOVERIES, TACKLES AND INTERCEPTIONSGoalkeepers dominate the recoveries table, with Robert Sanchez (Â£4.7m) at the top of the pile.Diogo Dalot (Â£5.1m) is the leading outfielder for recoveries, some 28 behind Sanchez. He’s the best-performing non-goalkeeper across the three above tables combined, with a total of 72 recoveries, tackles and interceptions.Cristian Romero (Â£5.1m) is close behind the Manchester United full-back on 64.Defenders and screening midfielders unsurprisingly fare well all told. Ryan Gravenberch (Â£5.0m), for example, is level with Romero on 64 recoveries, tackles and interceptions.One of the main arguments for broadening the scoring system is to make assets like Gravenberch worthy of consideration rather than just the Fantasy footnotes they are now.CROSSES AND KEY PASSESDwight McNeil‘s (Â£5.7m) stock would rise even further were players rewarded for crosses and key passes. He’s made a combined 31 of those this season.No player has registered more, although Bukayo Saka (Â£10.1m) is level with the Everton winger.Pedro Porro (Â£5.5m) is the leading defender, with 24.Underlying bonus would be particularly useful for players like McNeil, who is used to profligate teammates spurning the chances he has carved out.FOULS CONCEDED AND WONNewcastle fans will tell you how press-resistant Bruno Guimaraes (Â£6.3m) is. That’s writ large in the above tables.Even factoring in the deductions for fouls conceded, he’d be worth an extra 42 points as a result of fouls drawn. Teammate Anthony Gordon (Â£7.3m) is narrowly behind on 40.Lewis Cook (Â£5.0m) is the worst off, with just one foul won and a league-high 18 conceded.SHOTS ON TARGETFinally, some familiar names at the top of the shots on target table. Erling Haaland (Â£15.4m), unsurprisingly, leads the way on 23.He’s had over twice as many efforts on target as any other player apart from Mohamed Salah (Â£12.7m), who is on 15.Let us know whether you’d be for or against some of the suggested scoring system changes on trial above, or whether you’d like to see others implemented into FPL.SIGN UP HERE FOR ALL THE TOOLS YOU NEED TO WIN AT FPL!Skonto Rigga Neale is the Editor of Fantasy Football Scout.

Make these wingers forwards as well. Could adjust squads so you pick one less MID and one more FWD as well.The other thing to do would be simplify the pricing. It’s a simple game with simple rules and simple scoring… except price changes are driven by a hidden formula so complicated nobody can model the results.

I didn't know FPL existed until 2015, but they changed the UI, and went a bit crap, and they stopped it to concentrate on American football. Gareth bale went from2.7m (as people who had him at the end of the season sold him, and went to 18m, before he went a bit crap at Real Madrid. Ronaldo was £25m and RVP went from 18m to 9m as he was sold as he was out for 4 months. You could make 15 transfers a game, but rarely did, maybe a couple, because if you had bale at 18m, and he'd get sold, you'd sell him for the price you bought him for. Saka (if the game still existed, if he value shot up), may have bed to be of your bench for a few weeks util he was back, as you'f just lose too much money.It was a great way of playing the game. The price of the player at the start of the season would just be like FPL Towers but after that, the price would move around, depending on EO but you always had 100m to spend every week.https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/dailyfantasy/help/soccer/rules Open Controls PermalinkLogin To Reply   The Night Trunker. 4 days, 16 hours agoBought Pickford last week.

AI based t6eams will get the biggest boost as a result, and that is absolutely terrible for FPL.FPL towers have not thought about this very much.

They have benefitted from the easiest start, however, at least according to our Season Ticker.Perhaps the biggest story here is Manchester United.Their inability to finish chances is a concern. The Red Devils have scored over six fewer goals than expected given the quality of chances they have created.Unitedâ€™s shot conversion rate in the Premier League this season is just 5.6%. Only Crystal Palace (5.4%) and Southampton (5.3%) have worse averages.At the foot of the table, newly promoted Ipswich Town and Leicester City, plus Wolverhampton Wanderers, occupy the bottom three.EXPECTED GOALS CONCEDED (xGC) – GAMEWEEK 1-7 This content is restricted to Premium Members.\\nClick here to register and get access to Opta stats, the Rate My Team tool, Points Projections, 150+ Premium Member articles, exclusive videos, a customisable Season Ticker, the FFS Transfer Planner... and more!LAST CHANCE TO VOTE FOR US AT THE FOOTBALL CONTENT AWARDS – THE DEADLINE IS TONIGHT!DETAILS OF HOW TO VOTE HEREGO STRAIGHT TO THE VOTING PAGE HERESIGN UP HERE FOR ALL THE TOOLS YOU NEED TO WIN AT FPL!Posted by villans82 Follow them on Twitter 82 Comments Post a Comment  By: DateRatingSticky       TheBiffas 5 days, 3 hours agoThink I\\'ll bench Saka and play Dibling if he\\'s out, Palmer\\'s fixtures are tough and I don\\'t fancy Foden yet Open Controls PermalinkLogin To Reply   Now I\\'m Panicking 5 days, 3 hours ago4.5 from Southampton to save the day!

Sam FPLFamily 31 CommentsShareHaving resisted the urge to Wildcard over the opening seven Gameweeks, Sam from FPL Family looks at three times where she might activate the powerful Fantasy Premier League (FPL) chip.The decision of when to play the Wildcard is one that I’ve toyed with on multiple occasions in these early weeks. Before the season started, Gameweek 12 was my original thought.I’m generally a manager who likes to hold the chip for as long as possible. It means I’m less likely to need the second Wildcard early, too, and can save it for Blank/Double Gameweek season.However, I’ve been more flexible with my approach in the current campaign, having been unsure about how the new rolling of up to five transfers rule would impact decision-making. Ahead of Gameweek 6, I thought very seriously about playing the chip when 663,489 others used it.I kept looking at my squad and thinking it didn’t really need an overhaul. But not being able to afford the players I wanted later on was a real concern.As Gameweek 7 took place, three different strategies were at play in my head. Each of them has merits.Gameweek 8We’re currently on an international break, a traditionally popular time for a Wildcard.Having seven Gameweeks of data and knowledge is a decent enough sample size to work out which players are in sustainable form and worthy of FPL inclusion.Managers also have a fortnight to collect price rises and falls, which can be really helpful for team value. It also means two weeks of thinking time and not rushing such all-important decisions.Additionally, should there be key international injuries like we saw with Martin Odegaard (£8.2m) last time, you can react without needing a four-point hit. Bukayo Saka (£10.1m) is an early doubt after limping out of England’s defeat to Greece.READ MORE: Saka injury news: Carsley provides latest update But above all else, this break has a really great set of fixture swings. Teams like Manchester City, Tottenham Hotspur, Brentford and Everton are about to embark on, or are continuing, a great run of them. Wildcarding now lets managers benefit from attacking these fixtures.READ MORE: FPL Gameweek 8 Wildcard: Pros, cons and three possible draftsGameweek 12Sticking with two-week pauses, November brings another set of internationals. Coming a third of the way into this season, managers would have an even fuller understanding of form teams and players.There’s another set of fixture swings too.Not only that, Man City’s fixtures begin to toughen. They must face Spurs, Liverpool, Manchester United and Aston Villa over six matches.It’d therefore give managers the (difficult!) choice of moving away from Erling Haaland (£15.3m) and putting their money towards the Saka and Cole Palmer (£10.8m) combination.Gameweek 16Option three is not during a Premier League break. But it comes two weeks before the Boxing Day fixtures, soon after the midweek Gameweek 14 round.It means you can ‘dead-end’ a team based on the early December fixtures, before preparing, as much as possible, for further festive rotation.Getting a well-stocked bench will be advisable going into the Christmas period, a time of the season when teamsheets are at their most unpredictable.The five rounds from Gameweek 16 see numerous teams receive attractive fixtures from an FPL perspective.How I make my Wildcard decisionThere are a few questions I ask myself when considering the chip:Are there five or more players I want to get rid of?Do my current individuals have appealing fixtures and the potential for good FPL returns?Will waiting longer mean I can’t afford certain players?Would using it later enable me to make better decisions?With my current lot, Dean Henderson (£4.5m), Valentin Barco (£4.0m) and Harry Winks (£4.5m) are easy sells. But they’re not important enough to play such a valuable chip. For example, Barco has been sitting in my third bench slot all season and hasn’t been needed. His sale can wait slightly longer.I think that, for me, a Gameweek 12 Wildcard feels right. It brings an opportunity to remove the peripheral players and target differentials with good fixtures. Premium investment can be tweaked, allowing me to own Palmer for the first time this season.My Gameweek 8 plansHenderson was a poor Gameweek 1 decision for me. I had David Raya (£5.6m) throughout pre-season and then made a late call to save a million, in order to afford Dominic Solanke (£7.5m).Crystal Palace have been all at sea defensively, only managing to keep one clean sheet. I actually could sell the goalkeeper this week. Normally I avoid changes in this position but, as I don’t feel the need to make a change elsewhere, it’s a move to consider. I would then have £4.7m to spend.According to the Season Ticker, targeting Everton’s Jordan Pickford (£4.8m) would be wise but I’m marginally short of affording that.Nottingham Forest rank third on it and have a strong defence, offering clean sheet potential every week until Wildcard. However, the international withdrawal of Matz Sels (£4.5m) could turn into a problem.Then again, Palace’s short-term fixtures are also decent, with Gameweek 9’s Spurs meeting able to provide save points. So I need to consider whether the potential points upside is worth more than rolling the transfer.It’s not like clean sheets are ten a penny elsewhere anyway: the possibly injured Sels is the only £4.5m-and-under ‘keeper who has recorded more than one of them!If I decide not to use this week’s transfer, I’d then have two free ones for Gameweek 9. That might be a better landing point, especially on a Champions League week.SIGN UP HERE FOR ALL THE TOOLS YOU NEED TO WIN AT FPL!Sam FPLFamily <p>Fantasy Football Scout's General Manager.

That number will rise as the Gameweek 8 deadline approaches so, in the meantime, let‚Äôs take a look at Konsa‚Äôs potential replacements in the ¬£4.5m-and-under market.READ MORE: Alisson injury: What does it mean for FPL?JOACHIM ANDERSEN (¬£4.4m)The central defender has not taken long to settle at Craven Cottage as he spent the 2020/21 season on loan there. An excellent signing for Fulham, Andersen is a player who flies under the radar.He has totalled over 120 FPL points in two of his last three seasons and his 121 points last term was only one fewer than Trent Alexander-Arnold (¬£7.1m) and two fewer than Josko Gvardiol (¬£5.9m). He can certainly improve on those returns, too, given that Marco Silva‚Äôs upwardly mobile side are by far the best team he has played for.In his four appearances so far this season Andersen has already managed one clean sheet, and defensive returns are sure to improve as the schedule eases. Across the next five Gameweeks Fulham play three of the bottom five clubs.Since his first start in Gameweek 4, only two defenders have made more than his 41 clearances, blocks and interceptions (CBI), he is in the top 10 for aerial duels, and only Virgil van Dijk (¬£6.0m) has more clean sheets. The Denmark international also poses an attacking threat. Since Gameweek 4 only four defenders have had more goal attempts. All in all, Andersen is a differential with potential.LEIF DAVIS (¬£4.5m) \\xa0The rest of this article below is completely free to read but requires a Fantasy Football Scout user account for access – you can get yours at no cost hereSIGN UP HERE FOR ALL THE TOOLS YOU NEED TO WIN AT FPL!Posted by rocky7 72 Comments Post a Comment  By: DateRatingSticky       The Knights Template 6 days, 2 hours agoSubway Socceroos leading China 2-1. I’ve always loved them! Open Controls PermalinkLogin To Reply   Derbz87 6 days, 2 hours agoSlightly curious about the description of Joachim Andersen:He has totalled over 120 FPL points in two of his last three seasons and his 121 points last term was only one fewer than Trent Alexander-Arnold (£7.1m) and two fewer than Josko Gvardiol (£5.9m). He can certainly improve on those returns, too, given that Marco Silva’s upwardly mobile side are by far the best team he has played for.Feels a bit fishing for responses (congratulations I took a bite) on the comparisons with Trent and Gvardiol who played over 1000 minutes less than him. The last line is ridiculous too I think. Fulham might be slightly better than Palace have been the past few seasons but 'by far' is pushing it. Despite all of that he's a nice pick I think tends to do well in the bonus too I believe and Robinson probably isn't as attacking as you think he is for the price difference between the two. Open Controls PermalinkLogin To Reply   GreennRed 6 days, 1 hour agoFulham might get some decent league points but don't look such a good cleansheet bet. Their attack is decent. 1 CS in 7 games against average opposition. If Andersen doesn't get attacking returns like he did at Palace he's not a good pick. I'll, mischievously, argue that Sampdoria and Lyon are historically better than Fulham \\uf8ffüôÇ Open Controls PermalinkLogin To Reply   The FPL Units 6 days, 1 hour agoRather go RAN for the attacking returns.

Probably some luck there.Hoping on and off big players sounds good but when you have value tied up it's not so easy.Selling some of the higher value players might work best towards the final weeks to create a bigger bench that captures new opportunities and player changes on the final day.Thoughts Open Controls PermalinkLogin To Reply   Amartey Partey 6 days, 19 mins agoI feel like selling Diaz right now before a possible haul might be a good example of this.

They are also without a clean sheet in 17 Premier League games.Erling Haaland (£15.4m) is the clear front-runner for inclusion, with Gary O’Neil’s side particularly vulnerable to headers and crosses into their box.Above: All of the headed chances that Wolves have conceded this season, six of which have resulted in goalsDefensive representation is another possibility, with Wolves in the bottom three for expected goals (xG).Josko Gvardiol (£5.9m) lies joint-third among defenders for shots in the box (eight) and has taken up some excellent positions in recent weeks.Rico Lewis (£4.7m), who has been a regular name in Pep Guardiola’s starting XI this season, is another stand-out candidate.There is plenty of debate to be had about the rest of the Scout Picks but two players we’d struggle to see us going without are Mohamed Salah (£12.7m) and Brennan Johnson (£6.5m).Wesley Fofana (£4.5m) and Marc Cucurella (£5.0m) are both suspended for Chelsea’s clash with Liverpool, so Salah could get plenty of joy down the channels.Johnson, meanwhile, is currently enjoying a real purple patch for Tottenham Hotspur, scoring six goals in six games. He’s also attempted more shots in the box (21) than any other midfielder except Salah this season.IN CONTENTION \\xa0The rest of this article below is completely free to read but requires a Fantasy Football Scout user account for access – you can get yours at no cost hereSIGN UP HERE FOR ALL THE TOOLS YOU NEED TO WIN AT FPL!Posted by villans82 Follow them on Twitter 380 Comments Post a Comment  By: DateRatingSticky    PreviousFirst…123…Last» Next   dansmith1985 6 days, 5 hours agoKeep or sell Havertz?

Open Controls PermalinkLogin To Reply   Qaiss 6 days, 3 hours agoWhy does he have every right? Injuries happen in football. It’s a 25 man squad. Rodri was talking about the schedule but Guardiola had been playing him in every match for years. Cucurella plays once a week and is talking about the schedule And if some players believe they play too much, what’s the solution? How many more games are played compared with 10/20 years ago? Was the human body not capable back then? I said some footballers, because the vast majority are playing only once a week. Earnings are relevant, because like the poster above said, if you asked them if they want to play less and therefore earn less, they’d go quiet I’m not a fan of the new CL format or the nations league btw, the latter is a waste of time Open Controls PermalinkLogin To Reply   boc610 6 days, 2 hours agoCuccurella played every game for Spain at the euros then pretty much went straight into a new season after a pretty gruelling campaign with Chelsea the season before. He could be getting a symbolic wage of a euro a week or playing for free and the argument still stands. Footballers play too many games.  Any blank on the calender fifa fill and its down to greed.  The solution is obvious. More breaks, less football and you will get less injuries and a better product overall where the best players aren\\'t sidelined for the big games. But the notion that someone\\'s wages means an unsafe work environment (which is what this is ) is somehow acceptable and they should suck it up is ludicrous Open Controls PermalinkLogin To Reply   Haa-lala-land 6 days, 2 hours agoNoone here will know whether injuries to footballers have increased over the years, or the the types, all we have is players telling us they\\'re playing more games, and they don\\'t like that.Certainly in FPL it feels like a lot less yellow and red flags this season so far!I\\'m not quite there yet, Open Controls PermalinkLogin To Reply   boc610 6 days, 2 hours agoBen dinnery did a thing about this and they have increased Open Controls PermalinkLogin To Reply   x.jim.x 6 days, 2 hours agoMore games = more money = bigger wages + bonusesIt\\'s obviously demanding playing all the time, but top players are compensated extremely well for it. It\\'s massively out of touch to expect sympathy from the masses when you make more in a week than the majority of the country do in years. FIFA and UEFA are obviously bent as a 9 bob note, but they\\'ve already made changes to the game (more substitutions, bigger sub benches, etc) to encourage more rotation. Managers are actively choosing to work with smaller squads and how many times have we seen the likes of Guardiola refuse to make subs or Klopp trot out the same starting XI every single game over the years?Players know their own bodies better than anyone and I\\'m sure managers would be willing to rest them if they\\'re feeling the strain - problem is you don\\'t get your appearance fee if you\\'re sat in the stands...

They can earn those wages but they need to play the games Increased workload = more pay. Football player wages are so high because like you say, they’re market driven. Players want to take those wages and play less games though, which is not how it works. That’s the problem Do you think players would half their wages, in order to play less games? Highly, highly doubt it As for suffering physically, they have big squads, they have brilliant facilities to help them recover from playing matches. If you go far in all competitions, you have to use the squad and rotate. Some managers don’t rotate, players get injured and they blame the schedule If my employer increased my workload to the point I can’t cope, I would have to stop working for him. Most footballers love their job and the vast majority don’t complain about the amount of games there are to play It’s just a few, at some of the top teams, complaining as their manager won’t rotate or they want to reap the rewards of being a football player, whilst somehow telling us they should play less games.

His deputies Kovacic and Nunes combined didn\\'t even come close to that, with the latter playing less than 900 minutes across the season (for £50m btw). Three games were missed via suspension, so it\\'s likely he would have played even more (like the previous season).City played a total of 59 games last season (not including friendlies) - Rodri played in 50 of them, missed 3 via suspension, 1 via injury, and 5 via benching/squad omission. From the Community Shield to the first international break (27 days), they played him in 4 league games and 2 glorified friendlies (the CS and Super Cup).This isn\\'t a scheduling problem - this is a squad management problem.

Rocky7 107 CommentsShareLiverpool have been dealt a major blow with Alisson Becker (£5.5m) expected to be sidelined for six weeks.The 32-year-old was substituted in the second half of Saturday’s 1-0 win over Crystal Palace after picking up a hamstring injury.Alisson is therefore unlikely to play before November’s international break, missing crucial league fixtures against Chelsea, Arsenal, Brighton and Hove Albion and Aston Villa.In this article, we look at the potential impact of Alisson’s absence in Fantasy Premier League (FPL).READ MORE: FPL notes: Alisson + Munoz injury updates, Slot on Diaz v GakpoIN-FORM LIVERPOOLLiverpool have enjoyed a superb start to the season after racking up 18 points from six wins in their opening seven matches.The difference between this flying start by Liverpool compared to previous occasions when they have flown out of the blocks is that instead of blowing teams away with the sort of free-wheeling heavy metal football that we used to see under Jurgen Klopp, with clusters of goals from Mohamed Salah (£12.7m) and myriad assists from Trent-Alexander Arnold (£7.1m) and Andrew Robertson (£6.0m), Arne Slot’s early results have been based on solid defensive foundations.We cannot of course overlook the achievements of Salah. He has, after all, racked up four goals and four assists already and lies third in the rankings with 62 points, but Alexander-Arnold and Robertson have mustered only one assist between them.The main reason Liverpool are sitting on top of the league is because they have conceded a measly two goals. Two! If they were to continue at this rate they will only ship 11 goals all season, a feat that would break the record for the fewest goals conceded in a Premier League season of 15 set by Jose Mourinho’s Chelsea in 2004/05.ALISSON IMPACTLiverpool’s defensive obduracy is in no small part down to Alisson. The Brazilian has been in excellent form this season – as he demonstrated last weekend when he came top of the expected goals (xG) prevented table for Gameweek 7, single-handedly keeping Crystal Palace at bay with a series of vital stops before pulling up lame. Only four goalkeepers made more than his four saves from shots on target in Gameweek 7.Alisson has been one of the best goalkeepers in the Premier League ever since arriving at Anfield in 2018. In his first season at the club he won the first of his two Golden Gloves for keeping the most clean sheets, and since the 2019/20 season he has improved, maturing like a fine wine.SeasonAppsGoals concededClean sheetsxG preventedxG prevented rankSave %Save % rank2024/256242.73rd88.21st2023/2428308-117th76.12nd2022/233714148.52nd73.58th2021/223624201.13rd76.82nd2020/213332103.91st739th2019/20292314-2.619th72.57th2018/193822215.53rd79.21stAs you can see from the table above, he has ranked either first or second for save percentage in four of the seven seasons he has been at Liverpool and ranked in the top three for xG prevented in five of those seven campaigns.The worry for Liverpool is that, although only seven matches in, this season was his best to date. He ranks third for xGP, boasts a save percentage of 88.2% and has an unrivalled four clean sheets already.A major reason for this is the fact that Slot’s side have had a kind run of opening fixtures. The only team they have played so far from the current top 10 is Nottingham Forest – and that was the game they lost.Liverpool’s defence isn’t solely down to Alisson’s cat-like reflexes, of course. They have a solid defence marshalled by Virgil van Dijk (£6.0) and Ibrahima Konate (£5.2m), the latter of whom is flying under the radar with a goal and an assist to complement his four clean sheets.This defence is in turn shielded by a midfield that is adept at winning possession and keeping the ball at the other end of the pitch, which is why Alisson has faced the fewest shots of any goalkeeper this season with 17. Brentford’s Mark Flekken (£4.5m), by contrast, has faced 45 – albeit having played 104 more minutes.IS KELLEHER WORTH BUYING IN FPL?So the question is, will Alisson’s deputy, the attractively-priced Caoimhin Kelleher (£4.4m) be a cheaper route into arguably the best defence in the Premier League?The Irishman’s limited Premier League experience offers us only a sample size. He has played just\\xa0once in the Premier League this season, having missed Gameweek 7 through illness, but did excel in the 3-0 win over Bournemouth which was not as one-sided as it sounds.Kelleher had to make seven saves as the Cherries bombarded his goal in an end-to-end affair in which both teams fired off 19 shots. In fact, Kelleher had the highest save percentage of Gameweek 5 with a head-scratching 116.5% (seven saves from six shots on target!) to earn nine FPL points.Last season offers a slightly larger sample size as Kelleher made 10 appearances when Alisson had again succumbed to injury.SeasonAppsGoals concededClean sheetsxG preventedxG prevented rankSave %Save % rankAlisson2023/2428308-117th76.12ndKelleher2023/24101120.411th73.75thThe 25-year-old acquitted himself well, ranking fifth for save percentage and faring better than Alisson for xG prevented in that campaign. However, only two of Kelleher’s matches came against top-six sides and he would probably have hoped for more than his two clean sheets from encounters against teams largely floundering at the wrong end of the table like Sheffield United, Luton Town, Burnley and Nottingham Forest.So what we have to weigh up when considering whether it’s worth a punt on Kelleher is firstly, whether he will be well-protected by his defence thereby increasing his likelihood to keep clean sheets. The meagre 17 shots Liverpool have conceded so far would suggest that he will.However, the white elephant in the room is the fixture list. Liverpool’s schedule gets quite brutal from here on in.It’s fair to say that even Alisson would struggle to keep Chelsea, Arsenal, Brighton and Aston Villa at bay. Given that he could potentially be back after that, a punt on Kelleher probably isn’t worth it.SIGN UP HERE FOR ALL THE TOOLS YOU NEED TO WIN AT FPL!Posted by rocky7 107 Comments Post a Comment  By: DateRatingSticky    PreviousFirst…12…Last» Next   FDMS All Starz 6 days, 20 hours agoWould you do VVD & DCL to Lewis & Solanke for -4?

For me it's Milenkovic. Forest obviously look pretty solid defensively and those next 4 fixtures might be the best in the league. He's also ranked 11th for xG out of all the defenders and picked up an assist so far. I can just see a 15 pointer in one of those lovely home fixtures and it's doing my nut in.It's one of those low priority transfers that I really don't need to make... but if he scores and I don't own him it will be a brutal feeling.

On Saturday, they edged Bournemouth despite trailing 0.79-2.16 on the xG front. Half of that tally was a Jamie Vardy (£5.7m) sitter that would have been ruled out for offside by the VAR.Facundo Buonanotte (£5.0m) netted the winner, his fourth attacking return in six appearances this season. Two of those have been from the bench.If you’re tempted by the winger in FPL with a good fixture run ahead, be warned that Buonanotte now goes away with Argentina and will return late ahead of Gameweek 8.The winger’s goal means that Leicester, ranked 19th for expected goals, are the biggest overachievers on the xG front in 2024/25:Above: Premier League clubs sorted by xG overachievement in 2024/25 so farWASTEFUL CHERRIESBournemouth are at the opposite end of the spectrum.LeicesterBournemouthxG5.1012.24Actual goals scored98Wastefulness was the story of Bournemouth’s matches against Newcastle United, Chelsea and Liverpool. There was a familiar narrative on Saturday.“It’s happening to us. We are not finishing, we are not punishing the opposition, when you are playing better and when you don’t take your chances, you can lose these kinds of\\xa0games.” – Andoni IraolaMarcos Senesi (£4.8m), Illia Zabarnyi (£4.5m) and – twice – Dango Ouattara (£5.0m) all missed excellent headed chances, while Enes Unal (£5.4m) spurned a close-range injury-time opportunity.Antoine Semenyo (£5.7m) added another three shots to his collection. He remains the leading midfielder for shots attempted (31) this season.The problem for the Cherries now, of course, is the fixture schedule. Three of the toughest tests around in the next three Gameweeks, followed by a mixed bag thereafter:£4.0m JOHNSON SET FOR MINUTES BOOST?Ben Johnson (£4.0m) could be set for a minutes boost in the coming weeks and months.Positional rival Axel Tuanzebe (£4.0m), who sat out Gameweek 7 with a hand injury, looks set to be sidelined for a considerable period.“He’s done a hand injury, a very unfortunate accident. He’s had surgery and will be out for a while. It’s not going to be a couple of weeks, probably longer. There are still discussions with the specialists.“He’s naturally a miss with the way he’s started the season.\\xa0He’s going to be out for a little while. We’re going to have to adjust and regroup as a team.” – Kieran McKenna on Axel TuanzebeA word of warning, though. Johnson has started the season to mixed reviews at best when he has been afforded pitch time. He had another torrid afternoon on Saturday.And don’t count your chickens in terms of Johnson continuing to fill in for Tuanzebe. Long-term absentee Harry Clarke (£4.0m), another right-back, is now fit again and was back in the matchday squad at West Ham as a substitute.Either way, the absence of the solid Tuanzebe may slightly dent Leif Davis‘s (£4.5m) chances of future clean sheets. But the left-back will undoubtedly compensate with attacking returns. Three chances were created on Saturday, including one glorious one that was spurned by Jacob Greaves (£4.1m).Above: Davis is now the outright leading defender for chances created this seasonIt was from Davis’s half-cleared corner that Liam Delap (£5.6m) scored Ipswich’s only goal of the game. That’s now four goals in five matches for the striker. This one was a bit fortunate, as his shot should have been repelled by Alphonse Areola (£4.5m).HAMMERS RUN RIOTSloppiness from Kalvin Phillips (£4.9m) led to the Tractor Boys conceding their first goal. Johnson and Ari Muric (£4.4m) then combined to gift Jarrod Bowen (£7.4m) the Hammers’ third.“They didn’t have to work too hard for their goals. The fourth one was good play by them, but we still didn’t defend it well enough.“Other than that the goals came too easily from things that were too simple. They’ve got excellent quality and if you give them the chances then they can certainly capitalise on them.” – Kieran McKennaThis West Ham performance came out of nowhere, really, after three uninspiring displays. It was much needed for Julen Lopetegui, too.The Hammers boss can point to the fact that his side are unbeaten against the sides they’d expect to be tussling with this season. Their defeats have come to Manchester City, Chelsea and Aston Villa, with the other four matches – against Fulham, Palace, Brentford and Ipswich – resulting in two wins and two draws.It’s almost Manchester United-esque form (ie flat-track bullies) from the east Londoners, whose upcoming run is a mixed bag:Michail Antonio (£5.4m) claimed the most unlikely hat-trick of assists following his opener. His closing down of Muric’s clearance fell to Bowen for his solo goal, while Bowen owners would have been miffed at Antonio getting the slightest touch on his cross for Lucas Paqueta’s (£5.9m) tap-in. Mohammed Kudus (£6.3m) had earlier nodded in after Antonio’s header hit the crossbar.Four attacking returns in one game – half of his season totals in 2023/24 and 2022/23.Bowen also almost doubled his xGI for the campaign in one fell swoop. Five shots and five chances created were totals that he hadn’t bettered in any of the previous six Gameweeks.A breakthrough moment for the Hammers or back to the turgid Moyesian football next week?LAST CHANCE TO VOTE FOR US AT THE FOOTBALL CONTENT AWARDS – THE DEADLINE IS TONIGHT!DETAILS OF HOW TO VOTE HEREGO STRAIGHT TO THE VOTING PAGE HERESkonto Rigga Neale is the Editor of Fantasy Football Scout.

Open Controls PermalinkLogin To Reply   Derbz87 8 days, 3 hours agoHe\\'s an interesting one Delap. It seems as though he\\'s scoring a good amount of goals from pretty low XG and volume of shots. With better fixtures he probably gets better chances, isn\\'t always a guarantee he\\'ll finish them mind. Its a bit counter intuitive but some players can only score worldies through their ability and when they have time to think about what they want to do they tend to mess them up. There was potentially a bit of evidence of this in the Villa game when he had a great chance 1 on 1 with Martinez, good save to be fair but if you look at his technical ability on his goals he\\'s scored you\\'d say he should have buried the chance. We\\'ve not really seen enough clear cut chances for him to say one way or another. I\\'ve been really impressed with what I\\'ve seen and I\\'m surprised City let him go.

Open Controls PermalinkLogin To Reply   Ausman 8 days, 31 mins agoYou shouldn\\'t be downgrading a Premium. Premiums are the nucleus of your squad, and the cash cows are cheaper guys who find good form, rise in price, and are then sold on for better assets.

Wolves won\\'t keep many clean sheets, but he has attacking potential. Open Controls PermalinkLogin To Reply   Derbz87 7 days, 23 hours agoI was going to say Milenkovic too. Naturally we want to go to full backs in FPL for attacking potential but because Nuno is so rigid in his defence I don\\'t expect the full backs to actually get forward much and Milenkovic from JWP\\'s set pieces is probably their biggest goal threat from defence. I think Brentford are in the same sort of boat with their centre halves unless Rico Henry comes back as good as before but their defence is some way behind Forests.

Everything points to McNeil as the better pick but I also own DCL and a double up leaves an uneasy feeling in the stomach. If I go Rogers it\\'ll feel like a sort of Watkins replacement..ish. However I think Everton have the better fixtures across the next 4/5. Would you goa) McNeilb) Rogers?(Kulu is also a another potential option) Open Controls PermalinkLogin To Reply   Vincenzo 7 days, 12 hours agoA-Semenyo and J Pedro to McNeil and DelapB-Semenyo and J Pedro to Dibling and WoodFlekkenGab-Konate-RobinsonSalah-Saka-Mbeumo-Rogers-SemenyoHaaland-WelbeckFabiański-Digne-Faes-J Pedro0.5 in bank2 FT Open Controls PermalinkLogin To Reply   Kiwivillan 7 days, 12 hours agoA-Semenyo bagithi baba Open Controls PermalinkLogin To ReplyYou need to be logged in to post a comment.

These players selected below by the team at Fantasy Football Scout are being backed to score BIG over the coming Gameweeks.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGoalkeepers\\nAndre Onana (£5.0m): Manchester United’s shot-stopper is the highest-scoring goalkeeper in the game, registering 39 points. He has made 19 saves, resulting in four save points. He has also kept four clean sheets, saved a penalty and picked up three bonus points. The Red Devils have promising fixtures that should lead to more shutouts.\\nSee: Fixture Difficulty Ratings (FDR)\\nLukasz Fabianski (£4.0m): Onana would be the \"set-and-forget\" goalkeeper, meaning a player that you\\'re unlikely to use a transfer on to remove from your squad. A non-playing second goalkeeper has therefore been selected in this squad to save budget. Fabianski at £4.0m enables more budget to be distributed across the other 14 positions.\\nDefenders\\nGabriel (£6.2m): Arsenal are one of the elite defences in the Premier League. They have kept three clean sheets from their opening seven matches and they have only conceded six goals, despite already playing Aston Villa, Spurs and Man City. Gabriel is the pick of the Arsenal defenders. The centre-back has had 11 attempts on goal this season, with 10 of those coming from inside the box.\\xa0\\nRico Lewis (£4.7m): Even after two price rises this season, Lewis still feels like a bargain. It isn’t often that you can invest in a Man City defender with attacking threat for less than £5.0m, but Lewis offers that. The budget enabler has started six of the opening seven matches of the season, registering one clean sheet and two assists. Lewis boasts some attacking threat, producing four attempts on goal, as well as creating three chances for his team-mates.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                            Fantasy Premier League\\n                    \\nWhen is the best time to use your Wildcard in FPL?\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            When is the best time to use your Wildcard in FPL?\\n        \\nThe Scout pinpoints the opportunities ahead for managers who have yet to play the chip\\n\\nNathan Collins (£4.5m): While Collins and Brentford are yet to pick up their first clean sheet of the season, the centre-back has scored one goal and provided three assists. No defender has racked up more attacking returns, and with Brentford boasting some nice fixtures, he offers potential at both ends of the pitch.\\xa0\\nRayan Ait-Nouri (£4.4m): Although Wolves have conceded the most goals and are yet to keep a clean sheet, some good fixtures after Gameweek 8 and a strong attacking threat make the Algeria international a potential bargain. Ait-Nouri has created nine chances and is third among Wolves players for goal attempts, with nine. He has four attacking returns already this season, more than any team-mate.\\nJacob Greaves (£4.1m): Most Wildcard squads will likely need to include a £4.0m defender, and Greaves looks to be the best of them. Ipswich have a good run of fixtures between now and the busy festive period. The centre-back has had the most attempts on goal of all their defenders, with five.\\xa0\\nMidfielders\\nCole Palmer (£10.8m): Palmer’s two hauls against Wolves and Brighton in Gameweeks 2 and 6 have helped him become the joint-top scorer in 2024/25 Fantasy. His 11 attacking returns are more than any other player in the game, with the Chelsea star averaging 9.6 points per start.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nVideo is currently not available.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMute\\n\\n\\nPlay/Pause\\n\\n\\nClose\\nBack to top\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAD\\nCC\\nAudio description available\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBukayo Saka (£10.1m): Saka was substituted early in England’s first match of the international break against Greece, but as long as the prognosis is good then he looks like a key player to own on Wildcard. Saka has nine attacking returns this season, second only to Palmer among midfielders. His 27 chances created are significantly more than any other midfielder in the game. Of those, 12 have been big chances – situations where the player is expected to score – which again leads the way among midfielders.\\xa0\\nBryan Mbeumo (£7.5m): His six goals are tied for the most among midfielders. The Brentford star is currently averaging 7.3 points per match, while his nine bonus points are only bettered by the 11 of Mohamed Salah (£12.7m) in his position.\\nBrennan Johnson (£6.6m): He has impressively scored in all of Spurs’ last six matches in all competitions. Johnson has had 21 attempts on goal this season, more than any team-mate, and he has also created six chances and supplied 11 crosses. Spurs have great fixtures between Gameweeks 8-19, so their attack is definitely one to invest in.\\nMorgan Rogers (£5.3m): Aston Villa\\'s midfielder has emerged as a key budget enabler over the opening Gameweeks. Rogers has produced 11 attempts on goal, with eight coming from inside the box. He has also created 10 chances, with four of those classified as big chances.\\xa0\\nForwards\\nErling Haaland (£15.3m): Haaland, alongside Palmer, is the top-scoring player in the game. The Man City forward has scored 10 goals across the opening seven matches of the season. His 35 attempts on goal are 10 more than any other forward, while the Norwegian\\'s 57 touches inside the penalty area are more than any other player in Fantasy, boding well for his prospects of further attacking returns.\\nDanny Welbeck (£5.8m): Brighton’s Welbeck has five attacking returns this season, and is currently averaging 5.9 points per start. While Brighton have mixed fixtures in the short term, from Gameweek 12 the outlook improves significantly, so Welbeck looks a good pick over a longer period.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                            Fantasy Premier League\\n                    \\nWhich players are offering the best value in FPL?\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            Which players are offering the best value in FPL?\\n        \\nThe Scout looks at which positions are most likely to reward investment based on the opening seven Gameweeks\\n\\nLiam Delap (£5.6m): The Ipswich forward is in great form, with three goals over the last two Gameweeks. Delap has had 11 shots on goal, three more than Omari Hutchinson (£5.3m), who is the next best for the Tractor Boys. Eight of those attempts have come from inside the box, with five classified as big chances. Delap has four goals already, which only Haaland can better among forwards. That’s the same total as the likes of Kai Havertz (£8.3m), Ollie Watkins (£9.1m) and Nicolas Jackson (£7.9m), who all cost significantly more.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLatest News\\n\\nMore News\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                            Talking Tactics\\n                    \\nCan Gravenberch stop Palmer in crucial midfield duel?\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\'Gravenberch can do EVERYTHING.

There are also trips to Manchester United and Everton for Enzo Maresca\\xa0to contend with.\\nAston Villa and Fulham, who meet each other this Saturday, are both facing fixture lists that are rated 3.1 by the FDR. Villa will soon have to visit Spurs and then Liverpool in Matchweeks 10 and 11, before December sends them to both Chelsea and Man City.\\nAfter hosting Villa, Fulham go to Everton but the second half of the FDR chart illustrates the danger ahead, with a trip to Spurs being followed by matches against Arsenal and Liverpool back-to-back.\\nWho has the easiest fixtures?\\nThe FDR provides encouragement for some of the Premier League's early strugglers.\\nLeicester City and Ipswich Town, who are currently 15th and 17th respectively, have both been given an average FDR score of 2.4 for their next 10 fixtures.Seven of Ipswich's next nine matches are against clubs in the bottom half of the table, including Leicester, who will fancy their chances after getting their first victory against AFC Bournemouth in their last outing.\\nIpswich's next five PL matches\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIpswich Town\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n15:00\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSat 19 Oct\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\nEVE (H)\\n\\n\\n\\n15:00\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSat 26 Oct\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\nBRE (A)\\n\\n\\n\\n15:00\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSat 02 Nov\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\nLEI (H)\\n\\n\\n\\n14:00\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSun 10 Nov\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\nTOT (A)\\n\\n\\n\\n16:30\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSun 24 Nov\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\nMUN (H)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIpswich Town\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n15:00\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSat 19 Oct\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\nEVE (H)\\n\\n\\n\\n15:00\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSat 26 Oct\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\nBRE (A)\\n\\n\\n\\n15:00\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSat 02 Nov\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\nLEI (H)\\n\\n\\n\\n14:00\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSun 10 Nov\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\nTOT (A)\\n\\n\\n\\n16:30\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSun 24 Nov\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\nMUN (H)\\n\\n\\n\\nLeicester go to Newcastle United and Manchester United but have home matches against Nottingham Forest, Chelsea, West Ham United, Brighton & Hove Albion and bottom side Wolverhampton Wanderers.\\nWolves return to Premier League action with a daunting trip to Man City this weekend, but the FDR has rated their schedule at 2.5 and suggests the most demanding games in their next nine are the visits to Fulham and Everton.\\nRespite for Ten Hag?\\nMan Utd's next 10 fixtures could present a possible route up the table from their current position of 14th.\\xa0\\nTheir upcoming games are given a favourable rating of 2.7 - even though they travel to both Arsenal and Man City in Matchweeks 14 and 16 respectively.\\nBefore then, Man Utd will play Brentford, West Ham, Leicester, Ipswich and Everton, giving manager Erik ten Hag a chance to lift his team into the top half.\\nGreat run for Guardiola\\nThe FDR rates Man City's run-up to Christmas as the easiest among the teams near the top of the table.\\nTheir fixtures are rated 2.8, with the toughest matches for Pep Guardiola's side being the visits to Liverpool and Aston Villa.\\nArsenal, meanwhile, have a slightly tougher next 10 games, rated 2.9. After a potentially tricky trip to Bournemouth, they host Liverpool and then face Newcastle and Chelsea in Matchweeks 9 to 11.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLatest News\\n\\nMore News\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                            Talking Tactics\\n                    \\nCan Gravenberch stop Palmer in crucial midfield duel?\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t'Gravenberch can do EVERYTHING.

There are also trips to Manchester United and Everton for Enzo Maresca\\xa0to contend with.\\nAston Villa and Fulham, who meet each other this Saturday, are both facing fixture lists that are rated 3.1 by the FDR. Villa will soon have to visit Spurs and then Liverpool in Matchweeks 10 and 11, before December sends them to both Chelsea and Man City.\\nAfter hosting Villa, Fulham go to Everton but the second half of the FDR chart illustrates the danger ahead, with a trip to Spurs being followed by matches against Arsenal and Liverpool back-to-back.\\nWho has the easiest fixtures?\\nThe FDR provides encouragement for some of the Premier League's early strugglers.\\nLeicester City and Ipswich Town, who are currently 15th and 17th respectively, have both been given an average FDR score of 2.4 for their next 10 fixtures.Seven of Ipswich's next nine matches are against clubs in the bottom half of the table, including Leicester, who will fancy their chances after getting their first victory against AFC Bournemouth in their last outing.\\nIpswich's next five PL matches\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIpswich Town\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n15:00\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSat 19 Oct\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\nEVE (H)\\n\\n\\n\\n15:00\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSat 26 Oct\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\nBRE (A)\\n\\n\\n\\n15:00\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSat 02 Nov\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\nLEI (H)\\n\\n\\n\\n14:00\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSun 10 Nov\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\nTOT (A)\\n\\n\\n\\n16:30\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSun 24 Nov\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\nMUN (H)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIpswich Town\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n15:00\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSat 19 Oct\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\nEVE (H)\\n\\n\\n\\n15:00\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSat 26 Oct\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\nBRE (A)\\n\\n\\n\\n15:00\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSat 02 Nov\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\nLEI (H)\\n\\n\\n\\n14:00\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSun 10 Nov\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\nTOT (A)\\n\\n\\n\\n16:30\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSun 24 Nov\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\nMUN (H)\\n\\n\\n\\nLeicester go to Newcastle United and Manchester United but have home matches against Nottingham Forest, Chelsea, West Ham United, Brighton & Hove Albion and bottom side Wolverhampton Wanderers.\\nWolves return to Premier League action with a daunting trip to Man City this weekend, but the FDR has rated their schedule at 2.5 and suggests the most demanding games in their next nine are the visits to Fulham and Everton.\\nRespite for Ten Hag?\\nMan Utd's next 10 fixtures could present a possible route up the table from their current position of 14th.\\xa0\\nTheir upcoming games are given a favourable rating of 2.7 - even though they travel to both Arsenal and Man City in Matchweeks 14 and 16 respectively.\\nBefore then, Man Utd will play Brentford, West Ham, Leicester, Ipswich and Everton, giving manager Erik ten Hag a chance to lift his team into the top half.\\nGreat run for Guardiola\\nThe FDR rates Man City's run-up to Christmas as the easiest among the teams near the top of the table.\\nTheir fixtures are rated 2.8, with the toughest matches for Pep Guardiola's side being the visits to Liverpool and Aston Villa.\\nArsenal, meanwhile, have a slightly tougher next 10 games, rated 2.9.

Among the 19 players who have returned at least 6.0ppm spent, only TWO of them are forwards - Brighton & Hove Albion's Danny Welbeck (£5.8m) and Nottingham Forest’s Chris Wood (£6.2m).\\nBy contrast, SEVEN midfielders have achieved this feat, along with five goalkeepers and five defenders.\\xa0\\nWhen extending this out to players who have returned a minimum 5.0ppm spent, it’s a similar situation. Forwards are again the worst performers, supplying just six of the 44 players, compared with 16 midfielders and 15 defenders.\\xa0\\nCombined with the dominance of midfielders in the overall points standings, this indicates that a 3-5-2 formation could be the best way to capitalise on these trends, allowing managers to profit from the host of in-form, kindly-priced midfield options, while limiting their picks up front.\\xa0\\nBest positions for ppm value GW 1-7\\n\\n\\n\\nPosition\\n5.0ppm and above\\n6.0ppm and above\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGKP\\n7\\n5\\n\\n\\nDEF\\n15\\n5\\n\\n\\nMID\\n16\\n7\\n\\n\\nFWD\\n6\\n2\\n\\n\\nTotal\\n44\\n19\\n\\n\\n\\nWhich players are providing the best value?\\nAlong with Welbeck, Everton midfielder Dwight McNeil (£5.7m) and Liverpool centre-back Ibrahima Konate (£5.2m) are the only outfield players to have returned at least 7.0ppm over the first seven Gameweeks.\\nBoth McNeil and Welbeck have produced 41 points and are separated by just £0.1m in price, with the former the least expensive, at £5.7m.\\xa0\\nWhereas Welbeck faces Newcastle United, Liverpool and Man City over the next four Gameweeks, McNeil is set to embark on a kind run of opponents that hands him the chance to add to his three goals and two assists. According to the Fixture Difficulty Ratings (FDR), six of their next seven matches score only two in the FDR.\\nKonate, meanwhile, has combined a goal and an assist with four clean sheets to total 37 points. Although he sits four points behind his team-mate Trent Alexander-Arnold (£7.1m), who is the top-scoring defender, Konate has provided far better value, delivering 7.1ppm, compared with the right-back’s 5.8ppm.\\nManchester United defender Diogo Dalot (£5.1m) and Brentford's Mbeumo have been on a par with Liverpool’s Diaz for value, returning 6.9ppm and 6.8ppm respectively to the Colombian’s 6.7ppm.\\nCrucially, both Dalot and Mbeumo have the schedules to keep rewarding investors for many Gameweeks to come. According to the FDR, five of Man Utd’s next six matches score only two, while Brentford face Ipswich Town, Fulham, AFC Bournemouth, Everton and Leicester City across the next six Gameweeks.\\nNott’m Forest’s Wood and Arsenal centre-back Gabriel, meanwhile, have enjoyed identical starts to the season - both cost £6.2m and have produced 39 points, returning 6.3ppm spent.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                            Fantasy Premier League\\n                    \\nShould managers start targeting AWAY fixtures in Fantasy?\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            Should managers start targeting AWAY fixtures in Fantasy?\\n        \\nThe Scout explains why it may be time to reconsider which matches are most attractive in FPL\\n\\nThe New Zealand international is another who has an excellent run of upcoming fixtures, with each of Nott'm Forest's next three matches scoring a mere two in the FDR.\\nPalmer's appearance in the analysis is all the more remarkable considering his hefty cost of £10.8m.\\nIndeed, the Chelsea star is the ONLY premium player to feature in the best value assessment - he is the 12th best outfield player for value, returning 6.2ppm spent.\\nAlthough Haaland has matched Palmer's overall output and scored 10 goals in seven outings, the extra £4.6m outlay means the Norwegian has offered far less value. Haaland has returned just 4.4ppm, placing him only joint-13th among forwards, level with Aston Villa's Jhon Duran (£6.2m).\\nBest outfield players for ppm\\n\\n\\n\\nPlayer\\nPosition\\nPts\\nPrice\\nValue\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMcNeil\\nMID\\n41\\n£5.7m\\n7.2\\n\\n\\nWelbeck\\nFWD\\n41\\n£5.8m\\n7.1\\n\\n\\nKonate\\nDEF\\n37\\n£5.2m\\n7.1\\n\\n\\nDalot\\nDEF\\n35\\n£5.1m\\n6.9\\n\\n\\nMbeumo\\nMID\\n51\\n£7.5m\\n6.8\\n\\n\\nDiaz\\nMID\\n54\\n£8.1m\\n6.7\\n\\n\\nMadueke\\nMID\\n43\\n£6.5m\\n6.6\\n\\n\\nKovacic\\nMID\\n36\\n£5.5m\\n6.5\\n\\n\\nGabriel\\nDEF\\n39\\n£6.2m\\n6.3\\n\\n\\nWood\\nFWD\\n39\\n£6.2m\\n6.3\\n\\n\\nJustin\\nDEF\\n29\\n£4.6m\\n6.3\\n\\n\\nPalmer\\nMID\\n67\\n£10.8m\\n6.2\\n\\n\\nVan Dijk\\nDEF\\n36\\n£6.0m\\n6.0\\n\\n\\nSmith Rowe\\nMID\\n34\\n£5.7m\\n6.0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLatest News\\n\\nMore News\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                            Talking Tactics\\n                    \\nCan Gravenberch stop Palmer in crucial midfield duel?\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t'Gravenberch can do EVERYTHING.

He's also got decent goal threat, with four attempts from set-pieces this season.\\nLeif Davis (£4.5m) racked up 18 assists in the Championship last season, so the kind schedule for Ipswich Town should provide the full-back with opportunities to pick up some attacking returns.\\nI also feel West Ham United players have gone a little under the radar this season. With some reasonably obliging defences coming up in the short term in Tottenham Hotspur, Manchester United and Everton, I'd back the likes of Jarrod Bowen (£7.4m) to once again be in our thinking, particularly after his first double-digit haul of the season against Ipswich in Gameweek 7.\\xa0\\nPranil Sheth (@lateriser12)\\nPhil Foden (£9.2m) hasn't started the season well, but he's just about gaining full fitness now. Manchester City have a strong run of fixtures which could correlate to plenty of points for the midfielder.\\xa0\\nSee: Fixture Difficulty Ratings (FDR)\\nI also really like Matheus Cunha (£6.5m). Wolverhampton Wanderers have had a really tough start to the season and will soon have a long run of good fixtures. He's probably the most talented player in his price bracket and is a top budget forward.\\nFinally Spurs' James Maddison (£7.5m). He's been in good form since the start of the season in a very attacking Spurs team, who have a good run of fixtures now. His underlying numbers this season are very encouraging.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                            Fantasy Premier League\\n                    \\nFPL basics explained: How to use the statistics menu\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            FPL basics explained: How to use the statistics menu\\n        \\nThe Scout explains how managers can use data on the Fantasy website to help plan their transfers\\n\\nBen Crabtree (@FC_CrabDogg)\\nAs a Foden owner, I think he's under the radar due to his late return to the Man City team after his heavy involvement at UEFA EURO 2024. But as the cheapest of the big-hitters, he looks a great pick if he can return to his best.\\nBrennan Johnson (£6.6m) ticks all the boxes; cheap, on form, in an attacking team, high Expected Goals (xG) stats and good fixtures.\\xa0\\nMeanwhile, Raul Jimenez (£5.6m) is a forgotten man of FPL, but is in great form, with Fulham looking good this season. He's got some good fixtures and is cheaper than other budget forwards such as Dominic Calvert-Lewin (£6.0m) and Chris Wood (£6.2m).\\xa0\\nNick Harris (@WGTA_Nick)\\nMaddison has been performing excellently and has an xG tally of 2.0 and an Expected Assists (xA) total of 3.1 over the course of the season. With Spurs' good run of fixtures, I can see him doing well over the coming Gameweeks.\\nEverton's Dwight McNeil (£5.7m) has been a name that has been around for a long time, but he's having his best start ever to a Premier League campaign. Everton have some excellent fixtures to come, with Ipswich, Fulham, Southampton, West Ham and Brentford up next.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                            Fantasy Premier League\\n                    \\nWhich players are offering the best value in FPL?\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            Which players are offering the best value in FPL?\\n        \\nThe Scout looks at which positions are most likely to reward investment based on the opening seven Gameweeks\\n\\nRico Lewis (£4.7m) has looked excellent for Man City and could potentially have his breakthrough season. City have some great fixtures to come and I can see him returning not only clean sheets, but also goals and assists.\\xa0\\nGianni Buttice (@GianniButtice)\\nNoni Madueke (£6.5m) is under 10 per cent owned, very affordable and a cheap alternative to Cole Palmer (£10.8m) from the Chelsea attack. He is the sixth-highest scoring midfielder this season, with 43 points.\\nLiverpool's Ibrahima Konate (£5.2m) impressively sits third among defenders so far, with 37 points. At under 12 per cent owned and playing for the best defence in the league to date, he offers great value. But most importantly, he's a lot cheaper than the other regular starters at the back for the Reds.\\nFinally,\\xa0Kai Havertz (£8.3m) has five attacking returns from seven matches so far. Havertz has become super consistent and hasn't missed a minute for Arsenal so far this season, although at 20 per cent ownership, he is becoming less and less under the radar.\\xa0\\nAz Phillips (@FPLBlackBox_Az)\\nDavis is just two per cent owned and costs a mere £4.5m. It was a poor defensive performance against West Ham, but Ipswich have looked solid in other matches, despite playing Liverpool, Man City, Brighton & Hove Albion and Aston Villa.\\nHe takes corners and has an Expected Goal Involvement (xGI) of 0.86 over the last two Gameweeks, suggesting he's been unlucky not to get an attacking return. The fixtures are great too; no team has conceded more crosses down Davis' side this season than Gameweek 8 opponents Everton (82), with Gameweek 10 opponents Leicester City second for crosses conceded down his side, with 81.\\nSam Bonfield (@FPLFamily)\\nDespite scoring six goals in his last six appearances in all competitions, Johnson is remarkably still only owned by five per cent of FPL managers. He can extend that form given Spurs' fixtures.\\nLiam Delap (£5.6m) has scored three goals in his last two Premier League outings. He has had 11 attempts on goal this season, with eight coming from inside the box. His four goals so far this season are second among forwards only to the 10 of Erling Haaland (£15.4m).\\xa0\\nRayan Ait-Nouri (£4.4m) has a horrible fixture in Gameweek 8 at home to Man City, so bench him for that. But after that, Wolves have a great run that should lead to their first clean sheets of the season. Ait-Nouri has created nine chances this season and also ranks third among Wolves players for shots on goal, with nine. The defender already has four attacking returns this season - the most in the Wolves squad.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLatest News\\n\\nMore News\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                            Talking Tactics\\n                    \\nCan Gravenberch stop Palmer in crucial midfield duel?\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t'Gravenberch can do EVERYTHING.

A deeper squad will help.\\nLee Bonfield\\xa0(@FPLFamily)\\nHistorically, \"upside-chasing\" has been a good way to play the game and I have tried to do that this season, switching between the premium players with the most favourable matches to try to catch the biggest points hauls. However, this season, patience is key. A different star player is producing a big haul every week, so staying faithful seems likely to result in a better outcome.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                            Fantasy Premier League\\n                    \\nFPL glossary: Fantasy talk explained\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            FPL glossary: Fantasy talk explained\\n        \\nFrom \\'asset\\' to \\'Expected Goal Involvement\\', get to understand the terminology used in Fantasy\\n\\nGianni Buttice (@GianniButtice)\\nSure, Erling Haaland (£15.4m) is the best player in the game, but it\\'s OK to bet against him with the captaincy. The last couple of Gameweeks saw Arsenal have the better fixtures but many managers, including myself, were too worried to back the likes of Bukayo Saka (£10.1m) or Kai Havertz (£8.3m) over the Norwegian.\\xa0\\nNick Harris (@WGTA_Nick)\\nAt the start of the season, I chose too many players who weren\\'t guaranteed starters for their clubs, such as Christopher Nkunku (£6.0m) and Alejandro Garnacho (£6.3m). This forced me into an early Wildcard. It is better to make sure your squad is full of players who are nailed-on starters.\\nPras (@Pras_FPL)\\nFirstly, make sure you pick your premium players based on long blocks of kind fixtures. If you keep knee-jerking between them then the probability of it going very wrong is high, for example those that sold Saka for Cole Palmer (£10.8m) last week. Secondly, premium defenders are still worth the extra outlay - especially with the Bonus Points System (BPS) impact from goals conceded. Try to have two or three defenders from Arsenal, Liverpool and Man City for the foreseeable future.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                            Fantasy Premier League\\n                    \\nWho will benefit from changes to points-scoring in FPL?\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            Who will benefit from changes to points-scoring in FPL?\\n        \\nThe Scout explains alterations to the Bonus Points System and goalkeepers\\' rewards\\n\\nSam Bonfield (@FPLFamily)\\nAt the start of the season, I went with Dean Henderson (£4.5m) in goal, but actually the right answer was to invest a little more in this position. There haven\\'t been many clean sheets this season, especially for the £4.5m goalkeepers. Finding the extra £1.0m for the likes of David Raya (£5.6m) and\\xa0Alisson (£5.5m), prior to the Liverpool goalkeeper getting injured, would have paid off in these early weeks. Don\\'t be afraid to pay a little more for a premium goalkeeper.\\xa0\\nBen Crabtree (@FC_CrabDogg)\\nHaaland isn\\'t essential. There are big-hitters who can compete with his points tally and going without Haaland enables an extra premium player. Haaland isn\\'t an immediate sell, but he shouldn\\'t be treated as a must-have.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                            Fantasy Premier League\\n                    \\nWhy has Haaland blanked in his last two matches in FPL?\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            Why has Haaland blanked in his last two matches in FPL?\\n        \\nThe Scout delves into the data after Man City star failed to score against Newcastle and Fulham\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLatest News\\n\\nMore News\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                            Talking Tactics\\n                    \\nCan Gravenberch stop Palmer in crucial midfield duel?\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\'Gravenberch can do EVERYTHING.

Having produced 20 points in the corresponding fixture in 2023/24, those backers were confident the Norwegian would recover from his blank against Newcastle in Gameweek 6.\\nBut they were left sorely disappointed after he failed to play a part in any of his side’s goals in the 3-2 win over Marco Silva's side.\\xa0\\nAssessing the underlying statistics from each of Haaland's appearances this season helps give a better idea of why he has struggled recently.\\nHe had ZERO big chances – situations where the player is expected to score – in each of his outings against Newcastle and Fulham. \\xa0\\nIn contrast, he had at least one big chance in each of the first five Gameweeks, averaging two such opportunities per match and scoring 10 goals.\\xa0\\nHaaland's attacking stats GW 1-7\\n\\n\\n\\nGW\\nShots\\nShots in box\\nBig chances\\nGoals\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n2\\n2\\n1\\n1\\n\\n\\n2\\n7\\n6\\n3\\n3\\n\\n\\n3\\n5\\n4\\n3\\n3\\n\\n\\n4\\n6\\n6\\n1\\n2\\n\\n\\n5\\n6\\n6\\n2\\n1\\n\\n\\n6\\n5\\n5\\n0\\n0\\n\\n\\n7\\n4\\n2\\n0\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\nFurther analysis of Haaland's career with Man City indicates his recent mini-drought follows the same pattern as his previous two seasons.\\nIn his 2022/23 debut campaign, Haaland scored just one goal across the seven matches in which he had no big chances, against Wolverhampton Wanderers.\\nAnd he mirrored that output last season, with his goal against Brighton & Hove Albion\\xa0his only strike across the seven contests where he was devoid of any big chances.\\nEssentially, then, Haaland has scored two goals in the 16 matches where he has had zero big chances for Man City.\\nBut in the other 57 matches - where he's had at least one big chance - the 24-year-old has scored a staggering 71 goals.\\xa0\\nHaaland's big chances last three seasons\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n2022/23\\n2023/24\\n2024/25\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMatches with zero big chances\\n7\\n7\\n2\\n\\n\\nGoals in matches with zero big chances\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n\\n\\nMatches with at least one big chance\\n28\\n24\\n5\\n\\n\\nGoals in matches with at least one big chance\\n35\\n26\\n10\\n\\n\\n\\nImpact of De Bruyne's absence\\nThe creativity statistics certainly indicate that the recent absence of Kevin De Bruyne (£9.4m) has curtailed Haaland's output.\\xa0\\nDespite missing the last three Gameweeks through injury, the Belgian's 16 key passes and three big chances created both rank second only to Bernardo Silva (£6.5m) among team-mates. Along with summer signing Savinho (£6.5m), they are the only players to create more than one big chance for Man City this\\xa0 season.\\nJack Grealish (£6.4m) and Ilkay Gundogan (£6.5m), on the other had, have struggled to supply gilt-edged scoring chances. They have made a combined 21 key passes, but only one of those was regarded as a big chance created.\\xa0\\nMan City's top creators GW 1-7\\n\\n\\n\\nPlayer\\nKey passes\\nBig chances created\\nMins/key pass\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDe Bruyne\\n16\\n3\\n22\\n\\n\\nBernardo\\n19\\n5\\n29\\n\\n\\nGrealish\\n12\\n1\\n29\\n\\n\\nFoden\\n5\\n0\\n36\\n\\n\\nSavio\\n8\\n2\\n37\\n\\n\\nGundogan\\n10\\n0\\n39\\n\\n\\n\\nHow does Haaland's start compare with past seasons?\\nClearly the onus is on Man City’s creators to be supplying Haaland with better quality opportunities and it’s worth bearing in mind that De Bruyne and Phil Foden (£9.2m) have yet to start a match together this season.\\nNonetheless, an assessment of Haaland’s Man City career shows he still thrived without the Belgian in 2023/24.\\nHaaland had 15 big chances by Gameweek 7 in the previous campaign, compared with only 10 this time around. And that was despite De Bruyne playing a mere 21 minutes of those early 2023/24 matches, having sustained a long-term injury against Burnley in Gameweek 1.\\xa0\\nAlthough Haaland’s 35 shots and 10 headed shots this season both rank top when compared with the opening seven Gameweeks of his other two seasons, his ratio of big chances per shot is by far the lowest.\\nOnly 10 of those 35 shots, or 28.6 per cent, were regarded as big chances. That’s more or less HALF the 56 per cent ratio of his debut 2022/23 campaign, when 14 of his 25 shots in the first seven Gameweeks were big chances.\\nHaaland GW1-7 last three seasons\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n2022/23\\n2023/24\\n2024/25\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShots\\n25\\n32\\n35\\n\\n\\nShots in box\\n24\\n32\\n31\\n\\n\\nBig chances\\n14\\n15\\n10\\n\\n\\n% of shots as big chances\\n56.0%\\n46.9%\\n28.6%\\n\\n\\nHeaders\\n8\\n6\\n10\\n\\n\\nGoal conversion\\n40.0%\\n25.0%\\n28.6%\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy Man City’s schedule can get Haaland back to his best\\nDespite his recent failures, Haaland’s upcoming schedule suggests he could soon return to top form.\\nHis next two opponents, Wolves and Southampton, are both without a clean sheet this season and rank among the bottom three teams for goals conceded, with 21 and 15 respectively.\\nCrucially, they also place among the worst four sides for conceding big chances – only Ipswich Town and Leicester City have fared worse for this statistic, with 31 and 30 respectively.\\nWorst defences for big chances conceded\\n\\n\\n\\nClub\\nGoals conc.\\nClean sheets\\nBig chances conc.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIpswich\\n14\\n1\\n31\\n\\n\\nLeicester\\n2\\n1\\n30\\n\\n\\nWolves\\n21\\n0\\n26\\n\\n\\nSouthampton\\n15\\n0\\n25\\n\\n\\n\\nWith De Bruyne expected to be fit and Foden stepping up his match sharpness with a 77-minute runout at the weekend, those Gameweek 8-9 encounters will surely allow Man City’s key creators to improve Haaland's quality of scoring opportunities and help him get back to his prolific best.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLatest News\\n\\nMore News\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                            Talking Tactics\\n                    \\nCan Gravenberch stop Palmer in crucial midfield duel?\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t'Gravenberch can do EVERYTHING.
